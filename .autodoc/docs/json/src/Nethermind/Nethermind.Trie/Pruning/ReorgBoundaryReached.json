  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `ReorgBoundaryReached` that is used to signal when a certain block number has been reached in the process of pruning a trie data structure. The purpose of this class is to provide a way for other parts of the Nethermind project to be notified when a checkpoint has been reached during trie pruning.\n\nThe `ReorgBoundaryReached` class inherits from the `EventArgs` class, which is a base class for classes that represent event data. In this case, the `ReorgBoundaryReached` class is used to represent the event of reaching a reorg boundary during trie pruning.\n\nThe class has a single constructor that takes a `long` parameter called `blockNumber`. This parameter represents the block number that has been reached during trie pruning. The `BlockNumber` property is a getter-only property that returns the `blockNumber` value passed to the constructor.\n\nOther parts of the Nethermind project can subscribe to the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event and be notified when a reorg boundary has been reached during trie pruning. For example, a blockchain synchronization component might use this event to ensure that it has the latest state of the blockchain after a reorg has occurred.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event might be used:\n\n```\nvar trie = new Trie();\nvar pruningStrategy = new PruningStrategy(trie);\n\npruningStrategy.ReorgBoundaryReached += (sender, args) =>\n{\n    // Do something when a reorg boundary is reached\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Reorg boundary reached at block {args.BlockNumber}\");\n};\n\n// Perform trie pruning\npruningStrategy.Prune();\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `Trie` instance is created and a `PruningStrategy` instance is created with the `Trie` instance as a parameter. The `ReorgBoundaryReached` event is subscribed to using a lambda expression that writes a message to the console when a reorg boundary is reached. Finally, the `Prune` method is called on the `PruningStrategy` instance to perform trie pruning.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines a class called `ReorgBoundaryReached` which is used to determine which number is safe to mark as a checkpoint if it was persisted before.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?\n   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.\n\n3. How is the `ReorgBoundaryReached` class used in the Nethermind project?\n   - It is unclear from this code file alone how the `ReorgBoundaryReached` class is used in the Nethermind project. Further investigation of the project's codebase would be necessary to determine its usage."
