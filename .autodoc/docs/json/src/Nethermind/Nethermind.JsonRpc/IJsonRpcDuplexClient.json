  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` that is used in the Nethermind project for handling JSON-RPC communication between a client and a server. \n\nThe interface has three members: \n\n1. `Id`: a string property that represents the unique identifier of the client.\n2. `SendJsonRpcResult`: a method that takes a `JsonRpcResult` object as a parameter and returns a `Task<int>`. This method is used to send a JSON-RPC result to the client.\n3. `Closed`: an event that is raised when the connection between the client and server is closed.\n\nThe `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` interface is implemented by classes that handle the actual communication between the client and server. These classes use the `SendJsonRpcResult` method to send JSON-RPC results to the client and raise the `Closed` event when the connection is closed.\n\nHere is an example of how the `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` interface might be used in the larger Nethermind project:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyJsonRpcClient : IJsonRpcDuplexClient\n{\n    private readonly WebSocket _socket;\n\n    public MyJsonRpcClient(WebSocket socket)\n    {\n        _socket = socket;\n    }\n\n    public string Id => _socket.Id.ToString();\n\n    public async Task<int> SendJsonRpcResult(JsonRpcResult result)\n    {\n        var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(result);\n        var buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json);\n        await _socket.SendAsync(buffer, WebSocketMessageType.Text, true, CancellationToken.None);\n        return buffer.Length;\n    }\n\n    public event EventHandler Closed;\n\n    private void OnClosed()\n    {\n        Closed?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        _socket.Dispose();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyJsonRpcClient` is a class that implements the `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` interface. It takes a `WebSocket` object as a parameter in its constructor and uses it to send JSON-RPC results to the client. When the connection is closed, it raises the `Closed` event.",
