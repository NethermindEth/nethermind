  "summary": "The `JsonRpcConfig` class is a configuration class for the JSON-RPC server in the Nethermind project. It contains properties that define the behavior of the server, such as the host and port to listen on, the enabled modules, and the maximum size of a batch response body. \n\nOne notable property is `Enabled`, which determines whether the JSON-RPC server is enabled or not. If it is set to `false`, the server will not start. Another important property is `EnabledModules`, which is an array of strings that specifies the names of the modules that should be enabled. By default, it is set to `ModuleType.DefaultModules.ToArray()`, which returns an array of strings containing the names of the default modules.\n\nThe `WebSocketsPort` property is interesting because it is nullable and has a default value of `null`. If it is not set, it defaults to the value of the `Port` property. This means that if the `WebSocketsPort` property is not explicitly set, the JSON-RPC server will listen on the same port as the HTTP server.\n\nThe `MaxBatchSize` property determines the maximum number of requests that can be included in a batch request. If a batch request exceeds this limit, it will be rejected. The `MaxBatchResponseBodySize` property determines the maximum size of a batch response body. If a batch response exceeds this limit, it will be truncated.\n\nOverall, the `JsonRpcConfig` class provides a way to configure the behavior of the JSON-RPC server in the Nethermind project. It allows developers to customize various aspects of the server, such as the host and port to listen on, the enabled modules, and the maximum size of a batch response body. Here is an example of how to use the `JsonRpcConfig` class to configure the JSON-RPC server:\n\n```\nvar config = new JsonRpcConfig\n{\n    Enabled = true,\n    Host = \"0.0.0.0\",\n    Port = 8545,\n    EnabledModules = new[] { \"eth\", \"net\" },\n    MaxBatchSize = 100,\n    MaxBatchResponseBodySize = 10.MB()\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a class called `JsonRpcConfig` which implements the `IJsonRpcConfig` interface and contains various properties related to the configuration of a JSON-RPC server.\n\n2. What is the default port number used by the JSON-RPC server?\n   - The default port number used by the JSON-RPC server is 8545.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `RpcRecorderState` property?\n   - The `RpcRecorderState` property is used to specify the state of the RPC recorder, which can be set to `None`, `Record`, or `Replay`."
