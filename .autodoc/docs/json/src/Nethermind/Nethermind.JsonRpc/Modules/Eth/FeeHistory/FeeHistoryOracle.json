  "summary": "The `FeeHistoryOracle` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides a way to retrieve historical fee data for Ethereum transactions. The class implements the `IFeeHistoryOracle` interface and has a constructor that takes three parameters: an `IBlockFinder`, an `IReceiptStorage`, and an `ISpecProvider`. \n\nThe `GetFeeHistory` method is the main method of the class and takes three parameters: `blockCount`, `newestBlock`, and `rewardPercentiles`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper<FeeHistoryResults>` object that contains the historical fee data. \n\nThe `blockCount` parameter specifies the number of blocks to retrieve fee data for, starting from the `newestBlock`. The `newestBlock` parameter specifies the block number or block hash to start retrieving fee data from. The `rewardPercentiles` parameter is an optional array of doubles that specifies the percentiles to calculate for transaction rewards. \n\nThe `Validate` method is a private method that validates the input parameters. It checks that the `newestBlock` parameter is a block number and not a block hash, that the `blockCount` parameter is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1024, and that the `rewardPercentiles` parameter is a valid array of doubles. \n\nThe `GetRewardsInBlock` method is a private method that calculates the rewards for each transaction in a block. It takes a `Block` object as a parameter and returns a list of tuples that contain the gas used and the premium per gas for each transaction in the block. \n\nThe `CalculatePercentileValues` method is a private method that calculates the percentile values for the transaction rewards. It takes a `Block` object, an array of doubles, and a list of tuples that contain the gas used and the premium per gas for each transaction in the block as parameters. It returns a list of `UInt256` values that represent the percentile values for the transaction rewards. \n\nThe `GetFeeHistory` method retrieves the block data for the specified number of blocks starting from the `newestBlock`. It calculates the base fee per gas and the gas used ratio for each block and stores the values in stacks. It also calculates the transaction rewards for each block if the `rewardPercentiles` parameter is specified and stores the values in a stack. Finally, it returns a `ResultWrapper<FeeHistoryResults>` object that contains the historical fee data. \n\nOverall, the `FeeHistoryOracle` class provides a way to retrieve historical fee data for Ethereum transactions. It can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide fee data for various applications such as gas price prediction and transaction fee analysis.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FeeHistoryOracle` class?\n- The `FeeHistoryOracle` class is responsible for providing fee history data for Ethereum transactions.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `MaxBlockCount` constant?\n- The `MaxBlockCount` constant is used to limit the number of blocks that can be queried for fee history data to prevent excessive resource usage.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CalculateRewardsPercentiles` method?\n- The `CalculateRewardsPercentiles` method calculates the percentile values for transaction rewards based on the specified reward percentiles and the rewards in a given block."
