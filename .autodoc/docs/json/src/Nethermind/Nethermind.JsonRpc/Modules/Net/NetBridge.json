  "summary": "The `NetBridge` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides a bridge between the JSON-RPC API and the synchronization layer of the blockchain. It is responsible for exposing information about the local node and the network to the JSON-RPC API.\n\nThe class implements the `INetBridge` interface, which defines four properties: `LocalAddress`, `LocalEnode`, `NetworkId`, and `PeerCount`. These properties are used to retrieve information about the local node and the network.\n\nThe `LocalAddress` property returns the address of the local node. The `LocalEnode` property returns the enode URL of the local node. The `NetworkId` property returns the ID of the network that the local node is connected to. The `PeerCount` property returns the number of peers that the local node is connected to.\n\nThe `NetBridge` class takes two parameters in its constructor: `localNode` and `syncServer`. The `localNode` parameter is an instance of the `IEnode` interface, which represents a node on the Ethereum network. The `syncServer` parameter is an instance of the `ISyncServer` interface, which represents a synchronization server that is responsible for synchronizing the local node with the rest of the network.\n\nThe `NetBridge` class is used by the JSON-RPC API to retrieve information about the local node and the network. For example, the `eth_protocolVersion` method in the JSON-RPC API uses the `NetworkId` property to retrieve the ID of the network that the local node is connected to. Similarly, the `net_peerCount` method uses the `PeerCount` property to retrieve the number of peers that the local node is connected to.\n\nHere is an example of how the `NetBridge` class can be used in the larger Nethermind project:\n\n```csharp\n// create an instance of the NetBridge class\nvar netBridge = new NetBridge(localNode, syncServer);\n\n// retrieve the local node's address\nvar localAddress = netBridge.LocalAddress;\n\n// retrieve the local node's enode URL\nvar localEnode = netBridge.LocalEnode;\n\n// retrieve the ID of the network that the local node is connected to\nvar networkId = netBridge.NetworkId;\n\n// retrieve the number of peers that the local node is connected to\nvar peerCount = netBridge.PeerCount;\n```\n\nOverall, the `NetBridge` class is an important module in the Nethermind project that provides a bridge between the JSON-RPC API and the synchronization layer of the blockchain. It is responsible for exposing information about the local node and the network to the JSON-RPC API, which is used by external applications to interact with the blockchain.",
