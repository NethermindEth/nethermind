  "summary": "The `NetRpcModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides JSON-RPC methods related to network information. It implements the `INetRpcModule` interface, which defines the methods that should be implemented by a network module in order to expose network-related functionality over JSON-RPC.\n\nThe constructor of the `NetRpcModule` class takes an instance of `ILogManager` and an instance of `INetBridge` as parameters. The `INetBridge` instance is used to access network-related information, such as the local address, the local enode, the network ID, and the number of peers. The `ILogManager` instance is not used in this class, but it is likely used in other parts of the project for logging purposes.\n\nThe `NetRpcModule` class provides five JSON-RPC methods:\n\n- `net_localAddress()`: Returns the local address of the node as an `Address` object wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.\n- `net_localEnode()`: Returns the local enode of the node as a string wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.\n- `net_version()`: Returns the network ID of the node as a string wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.\n- `net_listening()`: Returns `true` wrapped in a `ResultWrapper` to indicate that the node is listening for incoming connections.\n- `net_peerCount()`: Returns the number of peers connected to the node as a `long` wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.\n\nThese methods are used to expose network-related information over JSON-RPC, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes. For example, a client application could use the `net_peerCount()` method to display the number of peers connected to the node, or the `net_localEnode()` method to display the node's enode URL. \n\nHere is an example of how the `net_peerCount()` method could be called over JSON-RPC using curl:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"net_peerCount\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' http://localhost:8545\n```\n\nThe response would be a JSON object containing the result of the method call:\n\n```\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":42}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `result` field contains the number of peers connected to the node (42 in this case).",
