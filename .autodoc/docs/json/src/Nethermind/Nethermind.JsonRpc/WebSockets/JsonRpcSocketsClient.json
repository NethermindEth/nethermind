  "summary": "The `JsonRpcSocketsClient` class is a client implementation for the JSON-RPC protocol over WebSockets. It extends the `SocketClient` class and implements the `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` interface. It is used to send and receive JSON-RPC messages over a WebSocket connection.\n\nThe class has a constructor that takes several parameters, including the client name, the WebSocket handler, the JSON-RPC processor, the JSON-RPC service, the JSON-RPC local statistics, the JSON serializer, and the maximum batch response body size. It creates a new `JsonRpcContext` object with the specified endpoint type and URL.\n\nThe class overrides the `Dispose` method to invoke the `Closed` event when the client is disposed. It also overrides the `ProcessAsync` method to process incoming JSON-RPC messages. It deserializes the incoming data into a `TextReader` object and passes it to the `ProcessAsync` method of the JSON-RPC processor. It then iterates over the resulting `JsonRpcResult` objects and sends them back to the client using the `SendJsonRpcResult` method. It also reports the handling time and size of each response to the JSON-RPC local statistics.\n\nThe class defines the `SendJsonRpcResult` method to send a `JsonRpcResult` object back to the client. If the result is a collection, it sends each response in the collection separately and reports the handling time and size of each response to the JSON-RPC local statistics. If the result is a single response, it sends the response back to the client and reports the handling time and size of the response to the JSON-RPC local statistics.\n\nThe class defines the `SendJsonRpcResultEntry` method to send a `JsonRpcResult.Entry` object back to the client. It serializes the response data into a `MemoryStream` object and sends the resulting byte array back to the client using the WebSocket handler. If the response data cannot be serialized, it sends a JSON-RPC error response back to the client with an error code of `ErrorCodes.Timeout` and a message of \"Request was canceled due to enabled timeout.\"\n\nOverall, the `JsonRpcSocketsClient` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's implementation of the JSON-RPC protocol over WebSockets. It provides a client implementation that can be used to send and receive JSON-RPC messages over a WebSocket connection and reports the handling time and size of each response to the JSON-RPC local statistics.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `JsonRpcSocketsClient` which is a client for sending and receiving JSON-RPC messages over websockets.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on `Nethermind.Core.Extensions`, `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules`, `Nethermind.Serialization.Json`, and `Nethermind.Sockets`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcSocketsClient` constructor parameters?\n- The constructor parameters are used to configure the `JsonRpcSocketsClient` instance. They include the client name, socket handler, JSON-RPC processor, JSON-RPC service, JSON serializer, and other optional parameters such as the maximum batch response body size."
