  "summary": "The `GCKeeper` class is responsible for managing the garbage collector (GC) in the Nethermind project. The GC is responsible for freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the application. The `GCKeeper` class provides a way to temporarily disable the GC, which can be useful in certain scenarios where the GC can negatively impact performance.\n\nThe `TryStartNoGCRegion` method is used to temporarily disable the GC. It takes an optional `size` parameter, which specifies the size of the memory region that should be excluded from garbage collection. If the `size` parameter is not specified, a default size of 512 MB is used. The method returns an `IDisposable` object, which can be used to re-enable the GC when it is no longer needed.\n\nThe `NoGCRegion` class is an internal class that implements the `IDisposable` interface. It is used to re-enable the GC when the `IDisposable` object is disposed. The `Dispose` method checks if the GC was successfully disabled by checking the `_failCause` field. If the GC was successfully disabled, the method re-enables the GC by setting the `LatencyMode` property to the previous value.\n\nThe `ScheduleGC` method is used to schedule a forced garbage collection. It checks if a forced garbage collection is already scheduled and if not, schedules a new one. The method uses a lock to ensure that only one forced garbage collection is scheduled at a time. The method also checks if a forced garbage collection was recently performed and if so, delays scheduling a new one.\n\nThe `ScheduleGCInternal` method is an internal method that is used to perform the forced garbage collection. It first determines the generation and compaction level to use for the garbage collection by calling the `_gcStrategy.GetForcedGCParams` method. It then waits for a delay of 1 second to allow time for any pending requests to complete. If the `LatencyMode` property is not set to `NoGCRegion`, the method performs a forced garbage collection by calling the `System.GC.Collect` method with the specified generation and compaction level.\n\nOverall, the `GCKeeper` class provides a way to temporarily disable the GC and schedule a forced garbage collection. This can be useful in scenarios where the GC can negatively impact performance, such as during high-volume data processing.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `GCKeeper` class?\n- The `GCKeeper` class is responsible for managing garbage collection in the Nethermind project.\n\n2. Why is the `TryStartNoGCRegion` method using `SustainedLowLatency` instead of `NoGCRegion`?\n- The `TryStartNoGCRegion` method is using `SustainedLowLatency` instead of `NoGCRegion` due to a runtime bug in .NET.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ScheduleGC` method?\n- The `ScheduleGC` method is responsible for scheduling garbage collection based on the parameters set in the `_gcStrategy` object."
