  "summary": "The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is a component of the Nethermind project that is responsible for requesting transactions from the transaction pool. It implements the `IPooledTxsRequestor` interface, which defines two methods for requesting transactions: `RequestTransactions` and `RequestTransactionsEth66`. \n\nThe `RequestTransactions` method takes a list of transaction hashes and an action to send a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` to the peer. It first checks if any of the transaction hashes are already known to the transaction pool, and if so, it does not request those transactions. It then sends a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` to the peer with the remaining unknown transaction hashes. \n\nThe `RequestTransactionsEth66` method is similar to `RequestTransactions`, but it takes a different type of message (`V66.Messages.GetPooledTransactionsMessage`) and wraps the `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` in it before sending it to the peer. \n\nThe `AddMarkUnknownHashes` method is a helper method that takes a list of transaction hashes and adds any unknown hashes to a list of discovered transaction hashes. It also marks the unknown hashes as pending in a cache to avoid requesting the same transaction multiple times. \n\nOverall, the `PooledTxsRequestor` class is an important component of the Nethermind project that enables nodes to request transactions from the transaction pool efficiently. It ensures that only unknown transactions are requested and avoids requesting the same transaction multiple times. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\nITxPool txPool = new TxPool();\nPooledTxsRequestor requestor = new PooledTxsRequestor(txPool);\nList<Keccak> hashes = new List<Keccak>() { ... };\nrequestor.RequestTransactions(msg => peer.Send(msg), hashes);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class?\n    \n    The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is used to request pooled transactions from the transaction pool.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `LruKeyCache` object `_pendingHashes`?\n    \n    The `_pendingHashes` object is an LRU cache used to store the hashes of pending transactions that have been requested but not yet received.\n\n3. What is the difference between `RequestTransactions` and `RequestTransactionsEth66` methods?\n    \n    The `RequestTransactions` method is used to request pooled transactions using the Eth65 protocol, while the `RequestTransactionsEth66` method is used to request pooled transactions using the Eth66 protocol."
