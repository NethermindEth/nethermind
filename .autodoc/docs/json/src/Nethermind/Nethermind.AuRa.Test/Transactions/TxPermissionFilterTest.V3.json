  "summary": "This code is a JSON configuration file for a test node filter contract in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this file is to define the parameters and settings for the test node filter contract, which is used to filter out unwanted nodes from the network. \n\nThe configuration file includes several sections, each with its own set of parameters. The \"engine\" section defines the consensus engine used by the network, which in this case is the authority round consensus algorithm. The \"params\" section defines various network parameters, such as the account start nonce, maximum extra data size, and gas limit bound divisor. The \"genesis\" section defines the initial state of the network, including the seal, difficulty, author, timestamp, parent hash, extra data, and gas limit. Finally, the \"accounts\" section defines the initial state of the accounts in the network, including their balances and built-in functions.\n\nThe most important part of this configuration file for the test node filter contract is the \"accounts\" section. This section defines the initial state of the contract's account, including its balance and constructor code. The constructor code is a hexadecimal string that represents the bytecode of the contract's constructor function. When the contract is deployed, this code is executed to initialize the contract's state.\n\nOverall, this configuration file is an essential part of the Nethermind project, as it defines the parameters and settings for the test node filter contract. By configuring these parameters correctly, the contract can effectively filter out unwanted nodes from the network, improving its security and reliability. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"TestNodeFilterContract\",\n  \"engine\": {\n    \"authorityRound\": {\n      \"params\": {\n        \"stepDuration\": 1,\n        \"startStep\": 2,\n        \"validators\": {\n          \"contract\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"params\": {\n    \"accountStartNonce\": \"0x0\",\n    \"maximumExtraDataSize\": \"0x20\",\n    \"minGasLimit\": \"0x1388\",\n    \"networkID\" : \"0x69\",\n    \"gasLimitBoundDivisor\": \"0x0400\",\n    \"transactionPermissionContract\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000005\",\n    \"transactionPermissionContractTransition\": \"1\"\n  },\n  \"genesis\": {\n    \"seal\": {\n      \"generic\": \"0xc180\"\n    },\n    \"difficulty\": \"0x20000\",\n    \"author\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"0x00\",\n    \"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n    \"extraData\": \"0x\",\n    \"gasLimit\": \"0x222222\"\n  },\n  \"accounts\": {\n    \"0xAB5b100cf7C8deFB3c8f3C48474223997A50fB13\": {\n      \"balance\": \"1\",\n      \"constructor\": \"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\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
