  "summary": "The code defines a class called `StaticSelector` which implements the `ISyncModeSelector` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to select a synchronization mode for the Nethermind project. The `SyncMode` enum is used to represent different synchronization modes, such as `Full`, `FastSync`, `FastBlocks`, `StateNodes`, etc. \n\nThe `StaticSelector` class has a constructor that takes a `SyncMode` parameter and sets the `Current` property to the provided value. Additionally, the class provides several static properties that return pre-configured instances of the `StaticSelector` class with specific synchronization modes. For example, the `FastSync` property returns an instance of `StaticSelector` with `SyncMode.FastSync` mode.\n\nThe class also defines several events, such as `Preparing`, `Changed`, and `Changing`, which are not implemented and do not have any subscribers. The `Stop` and `Dispose` methods are also defined but do not have any implementation.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to select a synchronization mode based on the requirements of the user. For example, if the user wants to synchronize the blockchain quickly, they can use the `FastSync` mode. If they want to synchronize the entire blockchain, they can use the `Full` mode. The pre-configured instances of the `StaticSelector` class make it easy to select a synchronization mode without having to manually create an instance of the class and set the `Current` property.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// Select FastSync mode\nvar syncSelector = StaticSelector.FastSync;\nvar syncMode = syncSelector.Current; // SyncMode.FastSync\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SyncMode` enum and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `SyncMode` enum is likely used to define different synchronization modes for the Nethermind project. It is used in this code to set the synchronization mode for the `StaticSelector` class.\n2. What is the purpose of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface and how is it implemented in this code?\n   - The `ISyncModeSelector` interface is likely used to define a common set of methods and properties that different synchronization mode selectors can implement. It is implemented in this code by the `StaticSelector` class, which provides a way to select a synchronization mode and exposes the current synchronization mode.\n3. What is the purpose of the `Preparing`, `Changed`, and `Changing` events in the `StaticSelector` class?\n   - It is unclear from the code what the purpose of these events is, as they are currently empty and do not have any subscribers. It is possible that they are intended to be used to notify other parts of the Nethermind project when the synchronization mode is changing or has changed."
