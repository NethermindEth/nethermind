  "summary": "The `SnapProviderHelper` class in the Nethermind project provides helper methods for adding account and storage ranges to a state tree during snap synchronization. Snap synchronization is a process of synchronizing the state of a node with the state of another node by exchanging snapshots of the state. \n\nThe `AddAccountRange` method takes a `StateTree` object, a block number, an expected root hash, a starting hash, a limit hash, an array of `PathWithAccount` objects, and an optional array of proofs. It adds the given accounts to the state tree and returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the result of the operation, a boolean value indicating whether there are more children to the right of the given range, a list of `PathWithAccount` objects representing the storage roots of the added accounts, and a list of `Keccak` objects representing the code hashes of the added accounts. The method first fills a boundary tree with the nodes required to add the given accounts to the state tree. It then adds the accounts to the state tree, updates the root hash, and commits the changes to the state tree. \n\nThe `AddStorageRange` method takes a `StorageTree` object, a block number, a starting hash, an array of `PathWithStorageSlot` objects, an expected root hash, and an optional array of proofs. It adds the given storage slots to the storage tree and returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the result of the operation and a boolean value indicating whether there are more children to the right of the given range. The method first fills a boundary tree with the nodes required to add the given storage slots to the storage tree. It then adds the storage slots to the storage tree, updates the root hash, and commits the changes to the storage tree. \n\nThe `FillBoundaryTree` method takes a `PatriciaTree` object, a starting hash, an end hash, a limit hash, an expected root hash, and an optional array of proofs. It fills a boundary tree with the nodes required to add a range of accounts or storage slots to a state or storage tree. It returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the result of the operation, a list of `TrieNode` objects representing the sorted boundary nodes, and a boolean value indicating whether there are more children to the right of the given range. \n\nThe `CreateProofDict` method takes an array of proofs and an `ITrieStore` object and returns a dictionary of `Keccak` keys and `TrieNode` values representing the nodes in the proofs. \n\nThe `StitchBoundaries` method takes a list of `TrieNode` objects representing the sorted boundary nodes and an `ITrieStore` object. It sets the `IsBoundaryProofNode` property of each boundary node based on whether its children are persisted in the trie store. \n\nThe `IsChildPersisted` method takes a `TrieNode` object, a child index, and an `ITrieStore` object. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the child node at the given index is persisted in the trie store. \n\nOverall, the `SnapProviderHelper` class provides useful helper methods for adding account and storage ranges to a state or storage tree during snap synchronization in the Nethermind project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AddAccountRange` method?\n- The `AddAccountRange` method adds a range of accounts to a state tree, updates the root hash, and returns information about the added accounts.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `FillBoundaryTree` method?\n- The `FillBoundaryTree` method fills a boundary tree with nodes from a proof dictionary, and returns information about the sorted boundary list and whether there are more children to the right.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StitchBoundaries` method?\n- The `StitchBoundaries` method updates the `IsBoundaryProofNode` property of boundary nodes in a sorted boundary list based on whether their children are persisted in the trie store."
