  "summary": "The `NetTestVectors` class is a collection of static methods and fields that provide test vectors for network encryption and handshake protocols used in the Nethermind project. \n\nThe `BuildSecretsWithSameIngressAndEgress` method returns an `EncryptionSecrets` object with the same AES and MAC secrets for both ingress and egress. This method is used to test the encryption and decryption of network packets using the same secrets for both directions. \n\nThe `GetSecretsPair` method returns a tuple of two `EncryptionSecrets` objects that are generated using the `EncryptionHandshake` class. This method is used to test the encryption and decryption of network packets using different secrets for ingress and egress. The method creates two `EncryptionHandshake` objects, one for each endpoint of a network connection, and sets the secrets for each endpoint using the `HandshakeService.SetSecrets` method. The method then compares the AES and MAC secrets for both endpoints and verifies that they are equal. Finally, the method compares the ingress and egress MACs for both endpoints and verifies that they are equal. \n\nThe remaining fields in the class provide test vectors for various components of the network encryption and handshake protocols. These include private and public keys, nonces, and pre-shared secrets. These test vectors are used to verify the correctness of the encryption and decryption algorithms used in the Nethermind project. \n\nOverall, the `NetTestVectors` class provides a set of standardized test vectors that can be used to test the network encryption and handshake protocols used in the Nethermind project. These test vectors help to ensure that the network protocols are implemented correctly and that the network is secure and reliable.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `NetTestVectors` class?\n- The `NetTestVectors` class contains static methods and fields that provide test vectors for network-related functionality in the Nethermind project.\n\n2.
