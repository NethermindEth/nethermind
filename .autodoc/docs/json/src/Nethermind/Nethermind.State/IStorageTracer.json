  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IStorageTracer` that is used to trace changes and reads to storage slots in the Nethermind project. The interface contains three methods and a property that control the tracing of storage and report changes and reads to storage slots.\n\nThe `IsTracingStorage` property is a boolean that controls whether storage tracing is enabled or not. If it is set to `true`, then the `ReportStorageChange` and `ReportStorageRead` methods will be called whenever there is a change or read to a storage slot.\n\nThe `ReportStorageChange` method is overloaded and takes either two `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` parameters representing the key and value of the storage slot that has changed, or a `StorageCell` parameter representing the storage slot that has changed, and two `byte[]` parameters representing the value of the storage slot before and after the change. This method is called whenever there is a change to a storage slot and depends on the `IsTracingStorage` property to determine whether to report the change or not.\n\nThe `ReportStorageRead` method takes a `StorageCell` parameter representing the storage slot that has been read. This method is called whenever a storage slot is read and depends on the `IsTracingStorage` property to determine whether to report the read or not.\n\nOverall, this interface is used to provide a way to trace changes and reads to storage slots in the Nethermind project. It can be implemented by other classes in the project to provide custom tracing functionality. For example, a class could implement this interface to log all storage changes and reads to a file for debugging purposes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\n// create a class that implements the IStorageTracer interface\npublic class MyStorageTracer : IStorageTracer\n{\n    public bool IsTracingStorage { get; set; }\n\n    public void ReportStorageChange(in ReadOnlySpan<byte> key, in ReadOnlySpan<byte> value)\n    {\n        if (IsTracingStorage)\n        {\n            // log the storage change to a file\n            File.AppendAllText(\"storage.log\", $\"Storage slot {key} changed to {value}\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void ReportStorageChange(in StorageCell storageCell, byte[] before, byte[] after)\n    {\n        if (IsTracingStorage)\n        {\n            // log the storage change to a file\n            File.AppendAllText(\"storage.log\", $\"Storage slot {storageCell} changed from {before} to {after}\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void ReportStorageRead(in StorageCell storageCell)\n    {\n        if (IsTracingStorage)\n        {\n            // log the storage read to a file\n            File.AppendAllText(\"storage.log\", $\"Storage slot {storageCell} read\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// create an instance of the MyStorageTracer class\nvar tracer = new MyStorageTracer();\n\n// enable storage tracing\ntracer.IsTracingStorage = true;\n\n// perform some storage changes and reads\nvar key = new byte[] { 0x01 };\nvar value = new byte[] { 0x02 };\nvar cell = new StorageCell(0x1234, 0x5678);\n\ntracer.ReportStorageChange(key, value);\ntracer.ReportStorageChange(cell, new byte[] { 0x01 }, new byte[] { 0x02 });\ntracer.ReportStorageRead(cell);\n```",
