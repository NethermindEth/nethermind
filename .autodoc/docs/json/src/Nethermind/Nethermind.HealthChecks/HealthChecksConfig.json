  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `HealthChecksConfig` that implements the `IHealthChecksConfig` interface. This class is responsible for configuring various health checks that can be performed on the Nethermind project. \n\nThe `HealthChecksConfig` class has several properties that can be set to configure the health checks. The `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether health checks are enabled or not. The `WebhooksEnabled` property is also a boolean that determines whether webhooks are enabled or not. The `Slug` property is a string that specifies the URL slug for the health check endpoint. The `PollingInterval` property is an integer that specifies the interval (in seconds) at which the health checks are performed.\n\nThe `WebhooksUri` property is a string that specifies the URI for the webhook endpoint. The `WebhooksPayload` property is a string that specifies the payload that is sent to the webhook endpoint when a health check fails. The `WebhooksRestorePayload` property is a string that specifies the payload that is sent to the webhook endpoint when a previously failed health check is restored. \n\nThe `UIEnabled` property is a boolean that determines whether the health check UI is enabled or not. The `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock` property is an unsigned long integer that specifies the maximum interval (in blocks) without a processed block. The `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock` property is an unsigned long integer that specifies the maximum interval (in blocks) without a produced block. The `MaxIntervalClRequestTime` property is an integer that specifies the maximum time (in seconds) for a JSON-RPC request to be processed.\n\nThe `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold` property is a float that specifies the low storage space warning threshold (in percentage). The `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold` property is a float that specifies the low storage space shutdown threshold (in percentage). The `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` property is a boolean that determines whether the low storage space check should await on startup or not.\n\nOverall, the `HealthChecksConfig` class provides a way to configure various health checks for the Nethermind project, including webhooks and UI. The properties of this class can be set to customize the behavior of the health checks.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `HealthChecksConfig` that implements an interface `IHealthChecksConfig` and contains properties related to health checks configuration.\n\n2. What are the default values for the properties in this class?\n- The default values for the properties in this class are: `Enabled` and `WebhooksEnabled` are `false`, `Slug` is `\"/health\"`, `PollingInterval` is `5`, `WebhooksUri` is `null`, `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` are JSON strings, `UIEnabled` is `false`, `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock` and `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock` are `null`, `MaxIntervalClRequestTime` is `300`, `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold` is `5`, `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold` is `1`, and `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` is `false`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties?\n- The `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties contain JSON strings that define the payload for webhook notifications sent when a health check fails or recovers, respectively. The strings contain details such as color, pretext, fields, and descriptions."
