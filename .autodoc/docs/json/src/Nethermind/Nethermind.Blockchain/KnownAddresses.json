  "summary": "The `KnownAddresses` class is a static class that provides a way to get a description of a given Ethereum address. It contains three public static methods: `GetDescription`, `GoerliValidators`, and `RinkebyValidators`.\n\nThe `GetDescription` method takes an `Address` object as an argument and returns a string that describes the address. It first checks if the address is present in the `GoerliValidators` dictionary. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. If not, it checks if the address is present in the `RinkebyValidators` dictionary. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. If the address is not present in either dictionary, it returns a question mark.\n\nThe `GoerliValidators` and `RinkebyValidators` dictionaries contain Ethereum addresses and their corresponding descriptions. The `GoerliValidators` dictionary contains addresses and descriptions of validators on the Goerli test network, while the `RinkebyValidators` dictionary contains addresses and descriptions of validators on the Rinkeby test network. These dictionaries are used by the `GetDescription` method to look up the description of a given address.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to provide a way to get a description of a given Ethereum address. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as when displaying transaction details or when analyzing smart contracts. For example, if a user wants to know the description of a particular Ethereum address, they can call the `GetDescription` method and pass in the address as an argument. The method will return the corresponding description, if available, or a question mark if the address is not present in either dictionary.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nAddress address = new Address(\"0x4c2ae482593505f0163cdeFc073e81c63CdA4107\");\nstring description = KnownAddresses.GetDescription(address);\nConsole.WriteLine(description); // Output: \"Nethermind\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `KnownAddresses` class?\n   - The `KnownAddresses` class provides static methods to retrieve descriptions of known addresses, such as validators and miners, for different Ethereum networks.\n2. What is the format of the `GoerliValidators`, `KnownMiners`, and `RinkebyValidators` dictionaries?\n   - The dictionaries have `Address` keys and `string` values, where the `Address` class is defined in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace and represents an Ethereum address.\n3. What happens if an address is not found in either the `GoerliValidators` or `RinkebyValidators` dictionary?\n   - The `GetDescription` method returns a question mark (`?`) as the default value.",
