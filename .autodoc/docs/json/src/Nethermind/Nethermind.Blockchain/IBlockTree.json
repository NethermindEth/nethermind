  "summary": "The `IBlockTree` interface is a part of the Nethermind project and defines the functionality of a block tree. A block tree is a data structure that stores and manages blocks in a blockchain. The interface provides methods to insert, suggest, and check the status of blocks in the tree. It also provides methods to update the main chain and to find information about blocks in the tree.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface inherits from the `IBlockFinder` interface, which defines methods to find blocks in the tree. The `IBlockTree` interface extends the `IBlockFinder` interface by adding methods to insert and suggest blocks, update the main chain, and find information about blocks.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface has several properties that provide information about the block tree. The `NetworkId` property returns the network ID of the chain. The `ChainId` property returns the chain ID of the chain. The `Genesis` property returns the genesis block of the chain. The `BestSuggestedHeader` and `BestSuggestedBody` properties return the best header and block that have been suggested for processing. The `LowestInsertedHeader` and `LowestInsertedBodyNumber` properties return the lowest header and body that have been inserted in reverse fast sync insert. The `BestKnownNumber` property returns the best downloaded block number. The `BestKnownBeaconNumber` property returns the best downloaded beacon block number.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface has several methods to insert and suggest blocks. The `Insert` method inserts a disconnected block header or body. The `SuggestBlock` method suggests a block for inclusion in the block tree. The `SuggestHeader` method suggests a block header for inclusion in the block tree. The `IsKnownBlock` method checks if a block is known. The `IsKnownBeaconBlock` method checks if a beacon block is known. The `WasProcessed` method checks if the state changes of a block can be found in the state tree.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface has several methods to update the main chain. The `UpdateMainChain` method marks all blocks as processed, changes the chain head to the last block, and updates all the chain levels. The `MarkChainAsProcessed` method marks all blocks as processed. The `ForkChoiceUpdated` method updates the fork choice.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface has several methods to find information about blocks. The `GetInfo` method returns information about a block. The `FindLevel` method finds the chain level of a block. The `FindCanonicalBlockInfo` method finds the canonical block info of a block. The `FindHash` method finds the hash of a block. The `FindHeaders` method finds headers of blocks. The `FindLowestCommonAncestor` method finds the lowest common ancestor of two blocks.\n\nThe `IBlockTree` interface has several events that are fired when a block is added to the main chain, when a block is set as head, and when a branch is set as canon.\n\nOverall, the `IBlockTree` interface provides a comprehensive set of methods and properties to manage blocks in a block tree. It is an essential component of the Nethermind project and is used extensively throughout the project.",
