  "summary": "The `CompositeComparer` class is a generic class that allows for the creation of a composite comparer that can be used to compare objects of type `T`. The purpose of this class is to allow for the creation of a comparer that can compare objects based on multiple criteria. \n\nThe `CompositeComparer` class contains a list of comparers that are used to compare objects of type `T`. The `FirstBy` method is used to add a new comparer to the beginning of the list of comparers, while the `ThenBy` method is used to add a new comparer to the end of the list of comparers. The `Compare` method is used to compare two objects of type `T` based on the list of comparers. \n\nThe `CompositeComparerExtensions` class contains an extension method that allows for the creation of a composite comparer using the `ThenBy` method. This extension method can be used to create a composite comparer that compares objects based on multiple criteria. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to compare objects based on multiple criteria. For example, it can be used to sort a list of objects based on multiple properties. \n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```\nvar comparer = new CompositeComparer<MyObject>(\n    new Property1Comparer(),\n    new Property2Comparer(),\n    new Property3Comparer()\n);\n\nvar sortedList = myList.OrderBy(x => x, comparer);\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyObject` is a class that has three properties: `Property1`, `Property2`, and `Property3`. The `CompositeComparer` is created with three comparers, one for each property. The `OrderBy` method is then used to sort the `myList` based on the `CompositeComparer`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeComparer` class?\n    \n    The `CompositeComparer` class is used to combine multiple `IComparer` instances into a single comparer that can be used to sort a collection of objects.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `FirstBy` and `ThenBy` methods in the `CompositeComparer` class?\n    \n    The `FirstBy` method is used to add a new comparer to the beginning of the list of comparers, while the `ThenBy` method is used to add a new comparer to the end of the list of comparers.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CompositeComparerExtensions` class?\n    \n    The `CompositeComparerExtensions` class provides an extension method that allows developers to chain multiple comparers together using the `ThenBy` method."
