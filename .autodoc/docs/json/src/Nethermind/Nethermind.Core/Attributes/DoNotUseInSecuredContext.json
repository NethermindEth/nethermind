  "summary": "The code above defines a custom attribute called `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` that can be applied to any element in C# code (indicated by the `AttributeUsage` attribute). The purpose of this attribute is to signal that the annotated code should not be used in a secured context, such as when handling sensitive data or performing critical operations. \n\nThe attribute takes a single string argument, which is stored in the `_comment` field. This argument can be used to provide additional information about why the code should not be used in a secured context. \n\nThe code also includes a `Todo` attribute that suggests a possible improvement to the implementation. The suggestion is to add a switch in a configuration file that would allow developers to enable or disable the use of code annotated with `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` in a secured context. If the switch is enabled and the annotated code is loaded, an exception would be thrown. \n\nThis custom attribute can be useful in a larger project like Nethermind, where security is a critical concern. By using this attribute, developers can clearly signal which parts of the codebase should not be used in a secured context, helping to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. \n\nHere is an example of how the `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` attribute can be used in code:\n\n```\n[DoNotUseInSecuredContext(\"This method uses an external API that is not secure\")]\npublic void SomeMethod()\n{\n    // Code that uses an external API\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SomeMethod` is annotated with `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` to indicate that it should not be used in a secured context because it uses an external API that is not secure.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` attribute?\n   - The `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` attribute is used to mark code that should not be used in a secured context.\n2. What is the significance of the `Todo` attribute used in the constructor?\n   - The `Todo` attribute is used to mark the constructor as needing improvement in terms of security, and suggests adding a switch in the config file to throw an exception when the attribute is loaded in a secured context.\n3. What is the scope of the `AttributeUsage` attribute used in the class definition?\n   - The `AttributeUsage` attribute is used to specify that the `DoNotUseInSecuredContext` attribute can be applied to any type of target."
