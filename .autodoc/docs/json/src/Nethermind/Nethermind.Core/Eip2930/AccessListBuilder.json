  "summary": "The `AccessListBuilder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to build an access list for Ethereum transactions according to the EIP-2930 specification. The access list is a list of addresses and storage keys that a transaction can access during its execution. The purpose of this class is to store the extra information needed to recreate the order of incoming transactions.\n\nThe class has three methods: `AddAddress`, `AddStorage`, and `ToAccessList`. The `AddAddress` method takes an `Address` object as an argument and adds it to the access list. The `AddStorage` method takes an `UInt256` object as an argument and adds it to the access list for the current address. The `ToAccessList` method returns an `AccessList` object that contains the data and order queue.\n\nThe `AccessListBuilder` class uses a dictionary to store the data and a queue to store the order of items. The `_data` dictionary is a dictionary of addresses and their corresponding storage keys. The `_orderQueue` queue is a queue of objects that represent the order of items in the access list. The `_currentAddress` field is used to keep track of the current address being added to the access list.\n\nThe `AddAddress` method sets the `_currentAddress` field to the provided address and adds it to the `_orderQueue` queue. If the address is not already in the `_data` dictionary, it is added with an empty `HashSet` of storage keys.\n\nThe `AddStorage` method adds the provided storage key to the `_data` dictionary for the current address and adds it to the `_orderQueue` queue.\n\nThe `ToAccessList` method returns an `AccessList` object that contains the `_data` dictionary and the `_orderQueue` queue.\n\nOverall, the `AccessListBuilder` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it provides a way to build an access list for Ethereum transactions according to the EIP-2930 specification. It is used to store the extra information needed to recreate the order of incoming transactions and is an essential component of the Ethereum transaction execution process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AccessListBuilder` class?\n    \n    The `AccessListBuilder` class is used to store the extra information needed to recreate the order of incoming transactions, as specified in EIP-2930.\n\n2. Why does the `AccessListBuilder` use a queue structure in addition to a dictionary?\n    \n    The `AccessListBuilder` uses a queue structure to store the order of items in the access list, since duplicates are allowed and the order of items matters. This is necessary because simply storing the access list as a dictionary would not preserve the order of items.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ToAccessList` method?\n    \n    The `ToAccessList` method returns an `AccessList` object that contains the data and order queue stored in the `AccessListBuilder`. This method is used to create the final access list that will be included in a transaction."
