  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` that extends the `IBlockFinalizationManager` interface from the `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide methods for managing block finalization in the context of the AuRa consensus algorithm.\n\nThe first method defined in this interface is `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy`, which takes a block hash as input and returns the last level that was finalized by that block hash. This method is used when there is nonconsecutive block processing, such as when switching from Fast to Full sync or when producing blocks. It is used to find a non-finalized `InitChange` event.\n\nThe second method defined in this interface is `GetFinalizationLevel`, which takes a level as input and returns the level at which finalization happened. If the checked level is not yet finalized, this method returns null. This method is used to check the finalization level of a given block.\n\nOverall, this interface provides methods for managing block finalization in the context of the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is likely that this interface is used by other components of the Nethermind project that implement the AuRa consensus algorithm. For example, a class that implements this interface might be used to manage block finalization in a node that is participating in the AuRa consensus algorithm.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface?\n   - The `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface extends the `IBlockFinalizationManager` interface and provides additional methods specific to the AuRa consensus algorithm for block finalization.\n2. What is the `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` method used for?\n   - The `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` method is used to retrieve the last level that was finalized by a certain block hash, which is useful for finding non-finalized `InitChange` events during nonconsecutive block processing.\n3. What is the `GetFinalizationLevel` method used for?\n   - The `GetFinalizationLevel` method is used to retrieve the level at which a certain level was finalized, or `null` if the level has not yet been finalized."
