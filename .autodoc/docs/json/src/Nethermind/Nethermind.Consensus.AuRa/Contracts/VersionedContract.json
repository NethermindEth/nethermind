  "summary": "The `VersionedContract` class is an abstract class that provides a way to manage different versions of a contract. It implements the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Activation` property. The class takes a generic type parameter `T` that must implement the `IVersionedContract` interface. The `IVersionedContract` interface defines a single method `ContractVersion` that takes a `BlockHeader` object and returns a `UInt256` value representing the version of the contract.\n\nThe `VersionedContract` class has a constructor that takes an `IDictionary<UInt256, T>` object, an `LruCache<KeccakKey, UInt256>` object, a `long` value representing the activation block number, and an `ILogManager` object. The `IDictionary<UInt256, T>` object contains the different versions of the contract, where the key is a `UInt256` value representing the version number, and the value is an object of type `T`. The `LruCache<KeccakKey, UInt256>` object is used to cache the version number of a contract for a given block header. The `ILogManager` object is used to get a logger instance for logging purposes.\n\nThe `ResolveVersion` method takes a `BlockHeader` object and returns an object of type `T`. It first checks if the block header is activated by calling the `BlockActivationCheck` extension method. If the version number for the block header is not found in the cache, it calls the `ContractVersion` method of the `_versionSelectorContract` object to get the version number. If the `ContractVersion` method throws an `AbiException`, it logs the exception and sets the version number to `UInt256.One`. The version number is then added to the cache. Finally, the `ResolveVersion` method returns the contract object corresponding to the version number by calling the `ResolveVersion` private method.\n\nOverall, the `VersionedContract` class provides a way to manage different versions of a contract and resolve the correct version for a given block header. It can be used in the larger project to manage the different versions of contracts used in the consensus algorithm. For example, the `AuRa` consensus algorithm uses this class to manage the different versions of the `StakingAuRa` contract.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `VersionedContract` class?\n- The `VersionedContract` class is an abstract class that implements the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface and provides functionality for resolving different versions of a contract based on the block header.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `IVersionedContract` interface constraint on the generic type parameter `T`?\n- The `IVersionedContract` interface constraint on the generic type parameter `T` ensures that only types that implement the `IVersionedContract` interface can be used as the type argument for `T`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `LruCache` field `_versionsCache`?\n- The `LruCache` field `_versionsCache` is used to cache the version number of a contract for a given block header, so that it does not need to be recomputed every time the contract is resolved for that block header."
