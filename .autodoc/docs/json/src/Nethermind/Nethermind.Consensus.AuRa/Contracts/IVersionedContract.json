  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `IVersionedContract` that is used in the AuRa consensus algorithm contracts in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to retrieve the version of a contract given a block header. \n\nThe `IVersionedContract` interface has a single method called `ContractVersion` that takes a `BlockHeader` object as input and returns a `UInt256` object. The `BlockHeader` object represents the header of a block in the blockchain and contains information such as the block number, timestamp, and hash. The `UInt256` object represents a 256-bit unsigned integer.\n\nThe `ContractVersion` method is used to retrieve the version of a contract at a specific block. This is useful in the context of the AuRa consensus algorithm, which uses a modified version of the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. In this algorithm, validators are selected based on their stake in the network and are responsible for creating new blocks. The version of the contract used by the validators can change over time, and the `ContractVersion` method provides a way to retrieve the current version of the contract for a given block.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ContractVersion` method might be used in the larger project:\n\n```csharp\nusing Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Contracts;\n\n// create a block header object\nBlockHeader blockHeader = new BlockHeader();\n\n// create an instance of a contract that implements the IVersionedContract interface\nIVersionedContract contract = new MyContract();\n\n// get the version of the contract for the given block header\nUInt256 version = contract.ContractVersion(blockHeader);\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyContract` is a class that implements the `IVersionedContract` interface and provides its own implementation of the `ContractVersion` method. The `version` variable will contain the current version of the contract for the given block header.",
