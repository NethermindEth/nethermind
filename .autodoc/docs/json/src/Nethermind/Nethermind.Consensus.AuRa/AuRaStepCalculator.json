  "summary": "The `AuRaStepCalculator` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to calculate the current step of the Authority Round (AuRa) consensus algorithm. The AuRa consensus algorithm is used in Ethereum-based blockchain networks to determine which nodes are allowed to create new blocks. The algorithm is based on a series of steps, each with a specific duration, and the `AuRaStepCalculator` class is responsible for calculating the current step and the time until the next step.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class implements the `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface and has four public methods and two public properties. The `CurrentStep` property returns the current step of the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `TimeToNextStep` property returns the time until the next step. The `TimeToStep` method returns the time until a specific step. The `CurrentStepDuration` property returns the duration of the current step.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class takes three parameters in its constructor: a dictionary of step durations, an `ITimestamper` object, and an `ILogManager` object. The step durations dictionary contains the duration of each step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `ITimestamper` object is used to get the current timestamp, and the `ILogManager` object is used for logging.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class has a private method `ValidateStepDurations` that validates the step durations dictionary. It checks that the step 0 duration is defined and that no step duration is 0. It also checks that the step durations are not too high and logs a warning if they are.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class has a private method `CreateStepDurations` that creates a list of `StepDurationInfo` objects from the step durations dictionary. Each `StepDurationInfo` object contains the transition step, transition timestamp, and step duration for a specific step in the AuRa consensus algorithm.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class has a private method `GetStepInfo` that returns the `StepDurationInfo` object for a specific timestamp.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class has a private method `GetTimeToNextStepInTicks` that returns the time until the next step in ticks.\n\nThe `AuRaStepCalculator` class has a private class `StepDurationInfo` that contains the transition step, transition timestamp, step duration, and step duration in milliseconds for a specific step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It also implements the `IActivatedAt` interface and has a `GetCurrentStep` method that returns the current step for a specific timestamp.\n\nOverall, the `AuRaStepCalculator` class is an important part of the Nethermind project and is used to calculate the current step and time until the next step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is a complex class that uses several private methods and a private class to perform its calculations.",
