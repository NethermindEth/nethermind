  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `DisconnectDetails` within the `Nethermind.Stats.Model` namespace. This class has two properties: `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason`, both of which are of custom enum types. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a way to store information about a disconnection event in the Nethermind project. The `DisconnectType` property indicates the type of disconnection that occurred, while the `DisconnectReason` property provides more specific information about the reason for the disconnection. \n\nThis class may be used in various parts of the Nethermind project where disconnection events need to be tracked and analyzed. For example, it could be used in a network monitoring module to keep track of nodes that have disconnected from the network and the reasons for their disconnection. \n\nHere is an example of how this class could be used in code:\n\n```\nDisconnectDetails disconnectDetails = new DisconnectDetails();\ndisconnectDetails.DisconnectType = DisconnectType.NetworkError;\ndisconnectDetails.DisconnectReason = DisconnectReason.Timeout;\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `DisconnectDetails` object is created and its properties are set to indicate that the disconnection was due to a network error and a timeout. This object could then be passed to other parts of the Nethermind project for further analysis or processing.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectDetails` class?\n   - The `DisconnectDetails` class is used to store information about a disconnection event, including the type and reason for the disconnection.\n\n2. What are the possible values for `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason`?\n   - The possible values for `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason` are not shown in this code snippet and would need to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?\n   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license."
