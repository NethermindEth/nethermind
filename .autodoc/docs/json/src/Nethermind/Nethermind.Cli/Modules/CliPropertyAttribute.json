  "summary": "The code above defines a custom attribute class called `CliPropertyAttribute`. Custom attributes are used to add metadata to code elements such as classes, methods, and properties. In this case, the `CliPropertyAttribute` is used to annotate properties of objects in the Nethermind project's command-line interface (CLI).\n\nThe `CliPropertyAttribute` class has four properties: `ObjectName`, `PropertyName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`. `ObjectName` and `PropertyName` are required parameters for the constructor and are used to identify the object and property that the attribute is applied to. `Description` is an optional parameter that provides a description of the property, while `ResponseDescription` and `ExampleResponse` are optional parameters that provide a description and an example of the response that the property returns.\n\nThe `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the attribute. The string representation includes the `ObjectName` and `PropertyName`, and if `Description` is not null, it is also included in the string.\n\nThis custom attribute can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide additional information about properties in the CLI. For example, if there is a property called `BlockNumber` in the `Block` object, the `CliPropertyAttribute` can be applied to it to provide a description of what the property represents and an example of the response it returns. This information can then be used by the CLI to display help information or to generate documentation.\n\nHere is an example of how the `CliPropertyAttribute` can be used:\n\n```\npublic class Block\n{\n    [CliProperty(\"Block\", \"BlockNumber\", Description = \"The number of the block\")]\n    public int BlockNumber { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CliPropertyAttribute` is applied to the `BlockNumber` property of the `Block` class. The `ObjectName` is set to \"Block\" and the `PropertyName` is set to \"BlockNumber\". The `Description` parameter is also set to provide a description of the property.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a custom attribute called `CliPropertyAttribute` that can be used to annotate properties in a CLI module.\n\n2. What properties can be annotated with this attribute?\n   The `CliPropertyAttribute` can be used to annotate properties with `ObjectName`, `PropertyName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior of the `ToString()` method?\n   The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the annotated property in the format of `ObjectName.PropertyName Description`. If `Description` is null, it is omitted from the string."
