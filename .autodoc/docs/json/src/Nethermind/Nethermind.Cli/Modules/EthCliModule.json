  "summary": "The `EthCliModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides a set of command-line interface (CLI) functions for interacting with the Ethereum network. The module contains methods for sending transactions, retrieving information about blocks and transactions, estimating gas costs, and more. \n\nOne of the key methods in this module is `SendEth`, which sends Ether from one address to another. It takes in the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount of Ether to send, and returns the transaction hash if successful. This method is used by the `SendEth` CLI function, which allows users to send Ether from the command line.\n\nOther notable methods in this module include `GetTransactionByHash`, which retrieves information about a transaction given its hash, and `GetBlockByNumber`, which retrieves information about a block given its number. These methods are used by the corresponding CLI functions, which allow users to retrieve information about transactions and blocks from the command line.\n\nThe module also includes methods for estimating gas costs (`EstimateGas`), retrieving account balances (`GetBalance`), and retrieving transaction receipts (`GetTransactionReceipt`). These methods are used by the corresponding CLI functions, which allow users to perform these actions from the command line.\n\nOverall, the `EthCliModule` class provides a set of CLI functions for interacting with the Ethereum network, making it easier for users to perform common tasks such as sending transactions and retrieving information about blocks and transactions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SendEth` method and how is it used?\n- The `SendEth` method is used to send Ether from one address to another on the Ethereum network. It takes in the sender's address, recipient's address, and the amount of Ether to send in Wei as parameters, and returns the transaction hash if successful.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `SendEth` and `SendWei` methods?\n- Both methods are used to send value on the Ethereum network, but `SendEth` takes in the amount to send in Ether and converts it to Wei internally, while `SendWei` takes in the amount to send in Wei directly.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CliFunction` and `CliProperty` attributes used in this code?\n- The `CliFunction` and `CliProperty` attributes are used to define command-line interface (CLI) functions and properties that can be accessed by users of the Nethermind project. They provide a convenient way for users to interact with the Ethereum network through the CLI without having to write custom code."
