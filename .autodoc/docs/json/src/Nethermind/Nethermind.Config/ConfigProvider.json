  "summary": "The `ConfigProvider` class is responsible for providing configuration settings to the Nethermind project. It implements the `IConfigProvider` interface, which defines methods for retrieving configuration settings and adding configuration sources. \n\nThe `ConfigProvider` class maintains a dictionary of configuration instances, where the key is the type of the configuration and the value is the instance of the configuration. It also maintains a list of configuration sources, which are used to retrieve configuration settings. \n\nThe `GetConfig` method is used to retrieve a configuration instance of a given type. It first checks if the instance is already in the dictionary, and if not, it initializes the configuration by calling the `Initialize` method. The `GetRawValue` method is used to retrieve a raw configuration value from a given category and name. It first checks the configuration sources for the value, and if not found, it looks for the value in the `Categories` dictionary. \n\nThe `AddSource` method is used to add a configuration source to the list of sources. The `Initialize` method is used to initialize the configuration instances. It first finds all the interfaces that inherit from the `IConfig` interface, and for each interface, it finds the direct implementation of the interface. It then creates an instance of the implementation and adds it to the `Categories` dictionary. It also creates an instance of the implementation and adds it to the `_instances` dictionary. Finally, it retrieves the configuration settings from the configuration sources and sets the properties of the configuration instance. \n\nThe `FindIncorrectSettings` method is used to find configuration settings that are not used by any configuration instance. It first initializes the configuration instances if they are not already initialized. It then retrieves all the configuration keys from the configuration sources and checks if they are used by any configuration instance. If a configuration key is not used, it is added to a list of incorrect settings. The method returns a tuple containing an error message and a list of incorrect settings. \n\nOverall, the `ConfigProvider` class provides a centralized way of managing configuration settings for the Nethermind project. It allows for easy retrieval of configuration settings and provides a way to add new configuration sources. The `Initialize` method is responsible for initializing the configuration instances and setting their properties based on the configuration sources. The `FindIncorrectSettings` method is useful for finding unused configuration settings and can be used to clean up the configuration sources.",

What is the purpose of the `FindIncorrectSettings` method?\n    \n    The `FindIncorrectSettings` method finds any configuration settings that are not being used by the project and returns a list of them along with their source, category, and name."
