  "summary": "This code defines a class called `Build` within the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to create instances of a `ReceiptBuilder` class. \n\nThe `ReceiptBuilder` class is not defined in this file, but it is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project. The `Build` class provides a property called `Receipt` which returns a new instance of the `ReceiptBuilder` class. This is achieved using C# 9's new feature of \"target-typed new expressions\", which allows us to create a new instance of an object without explicitly specifying its type.\n\nThis code is useful because it allows developers to easily create instances of the `ReceiptBuilder` class without having to manually instantiate it every time. This can save time and reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nusing Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders;\n\n// ...\n\nvar build = new Build();\nvar receiptBuilder = build.Receipt;\n\n// Use the receiptBuilder instance to build a receipt object\nvar receipt = receiptBuilder\n    .WithTransactionHash(\"0x123...\")\n    .WithGasUsed(1000)\n    .Build();\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new instance of the `Build` class and use its `Receipt` property to create a new instance of the `ReceiptBuilder` class. We then use the `receiptBuilder` instance to set some properties on the `Receipt` object and finally call the `Build` method to create the final `Receipt` object.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and convenient way to create instances of the `ReceiptBuilder` class, which can be useful in various parts of the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ReceiptBuilder` class?\n   - The `ReceiptBuilder` class is used to build receipts in the Nethermind Core Test project.\n\n2. Why is the `ReceiptBuilder` property defined as a partial class?\n   - The `ReceiptBuilder` property is defined as a partial class to allow for additional functionality to be added to the class in separate files.\n\n3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?\n   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license."
