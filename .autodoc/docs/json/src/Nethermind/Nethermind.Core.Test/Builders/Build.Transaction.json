  "summary": "This code defines a class called `Build` within the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide a set of methods that can be used to build different types of transactions. \n\nThe `Build` class contains four methods that return instances of `TransactionBuilder` objects. Each of these methods returns a different type of `TransactionBuilder` object, which can be used to build transactions of the corresponding type. The four types of transactions that can be built using these methods are:\n\n- `Transaction`: This method returns a `TransactionBuilder` object that can be used to build a standard transaction.\n- `SystemTransaction`: This method returns a `TransactionBuilder` object that can be used to build a system transaction.\n- `GeneratedTransaction`: This method returns a `TransactionBuilder` object that can be used to build a generated transaction.\n- `TypedTransaction<T>()`: This method returns a `TransactionBuilder` object that can be used to build a transaction of a specific type `T`, where `T` is a subclass of `Transaction`.\n\nIn addition to these four methods, the `Build` class also contains a method called `NamedTransaction`, which takes a string parameter `name` and returns a `TransactionBuilder` object that can be used to build a named transaction. The `NamedTransaction` method sets the `Name` property of the `TestObjectInternal` property of the `TransactionBuilder` object to the value of the `name` parameter.\n\nOverall, the `Build` class provides a convenient way to create different types of transactions for testing purposes. Developers can use the methods provided by this class to quickly create transactions of different types without having to write boilerplate code for each type of transaction. For example, a developer could use the `Transaction` method to create a standard transaction like this:\n\n```\nvar builder = new Build();\nvar transaction = builder.Transaction\n    .WithNonce(1)\n    .WithValue(100)\n    .WithGasPrice(10)\n    .WithGasLimit(1000)\n    .WithTo(new Address(\"0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890\"))\n    .Build();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionBuilder` class and its various generic types?\n   - The `TransactionBuilder` class is used to build different types of transactions, including `Transaction`, `SystemTransaction`, `GeneratedTransaction`, and any custom transaction type that extends `Transaction`. \n\n2. What is the purpose of the `NamedTransaction` method?\n   - The `NamedTransaction` method returns a `TransactionBuilder` instance with a `Name` property set to the provided `name` parameter. This can be used to create named transactions for testing purposes.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?\n   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license."
