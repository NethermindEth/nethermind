  "summary": "The `MevMegabundle` class is a subclass of `MevBundle` and represents a bundle of transactions that can be executed together. It contains information about the block number, a list of transactions, and optional parameters such as a relay signature and a range of timestamps. \n\nThe constructor takes in the block number, a list of `BundleTransaction` objects, and optional parameters such as `revertingTxHashes`, `relaySignature`, `minTimestamp`, and `maxTimestamp`. The `revertingTxHashes` parameter is an array of `Keccak` hashes of transactions that revert when executed. The `relaySignature` parameter is a `Signature` object that can be used to verify the authenticity of the bundle. The `minTimestamp` and `maxTimestamp` parameters define a range of timestamps for the transactions in the bundle.\n\nThe `Hash` property is an override of the `Hash` property in the `MevBundle` class and returns the hash of the bundle. The `RelaySignature` property is a nullable `Signature` object that can be used to verify the authenticity of the bundle. The `RelayAddress` property is an internal settable `Address` object that represents the address of the relay that submitted the bundle. The `RevertingTxHashes` property is an array of `Keccak` hashes of transactions that revert when executed.\n\nThe `Equals` method is an implementation of the `IEquatable` interface and checks if two `MevMegabundle` objects are equal. The `GetHashCode` method returns a hash code for the `MevMegabundle` object. The `ToString` method returns a string representation of the `MevMegabundle` object.\n\nThis class is used to represent a bundle of transactions that can be executed together. It contains information about the block number, a list of transactions, and optional parameters such as a relay signature and a range of timestamps. The `MevMegabundle` class is a subclass of `MevBundle` and inherits its properties and methods. It can be used in the larger project to facilitate the execution of bundles of transactions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\nvar transactions = new List<BundleTransaction>();\n// add transactions to the list\nvar bundle = new MevMegabundle(12345, transactions);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MevMegabundle` class and how does it relate to the `MevBundle` class?\n- The `MevMegabundle` class is a subclass of `MevBundle` and represents a bundle of transactions that can be executed atomically. It adds additional properties such as `RelaySignature` and `RevertingTxHashes`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `RelaySignature` property and how is it used?\n- The `RelaySignature` property is a digital signature that can be used to verify that the bundle was created by a trusted party. It is set in the constructor and can be accessed and modified using the property getter and setter.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `RevertingTxHashes` property and how is it initialized?\n- The `RevertingTxHashes` property is an array of `Keccak` hashes that represent the transactions in the bundle that revert when executed. It is initialized in the constructor and can be accessed using the property getter. If no reverting transactions are present, it is set to an empty array."
