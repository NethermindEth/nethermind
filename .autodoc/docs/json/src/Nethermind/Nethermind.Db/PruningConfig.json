  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `PruningConfig` that implements the `IPruningConfig` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide configuration options for pruning data from a database. Pruning is the process of removing old or unnecessary data from a database to reduce its size and improve performance.\n\nThe `PruningConfig` class has several properties that can be used to configure pruning behavior. The `Enabled` property is a boolean value that determines whether pruning is enabled or not. If `Enabled` is set to `true`, the `Mode` property is set to include the `PruningMode.Memory` flag. If `Enabled` is set to `false`, the `PruningMode.Memory` flag is removed from the `Mode` property.\n\nThe `Mode` property is an enum value that determines the pruning mode. The `PruningMode` enum has three possible values: `Full`, `Memory`, and `Hybrid`. `Full` mode prunes all data except for the most recent state, `Memory` mode prunes data that is not currently in memory, and `Hybrid` mode is a combination of `Full` and `Memory` modes.\n\nThe `CacheMb` property is a long value that determines the size of the cache in megabytes. The `PersistenceInterval` property is a long value that determines the number of blocks between persistence checks. The `FullPruningThresholdMb` property is a long value that determines the size of the database in megabytes at which full pruning is triggered.\n\nThe `FullPruningTrigger` property is an enum value that determines the trigger for full pruning. The `FullPruningMaxDegreeOfParallelism` property is an integer value that determines the maximum degree of parallelism for full pruning. The `FullPruningMemoryBudgetMb` property is an integer value that determines the memory budget for full pruning. The `FullPruningMinimumDelayHours` property is an integer value that determines the minimum delay in hours before full pruning can be triggered again. The `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property is an enum value that determines the behavior after full pruning is completed.\n\nOverall, the `PruningConfig` class provides a flexible way to configure pruning behavior for a database in the Nethermind project. Developers can use this class to fine-tune the pruning behavior to meet their specific needs. For example, they can enable or disable pruning, choose the pruning mode, set the cache size, and configure full pruning behavior.",

What is the default value for the `Mode` property?\n    \n    The default value for the `Mode` property is `PruningMode.Hybrid`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property?\n    \n    The `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property is used to specify the behavior of the system after a full pruning operation is completed."
