  "summary": "This code is a shell script that restarts the `nethermind.service` on a Linux system. The `nethermind.service` is a system service that runs the Nethermind Ethereum client. \n\nThe script starts by defining two variables `On_Green` and `Color_Off` that are used to color the output of the script. The `On_Green` variable sets the background color of the output to green, while the `Color_Off` variable resets the color to the default. \n\nThe script then prints a message to the console indicating that the `nethermind.service` is being restarted. This message is colored green using the `On_Green` variable. \n\nThe `restartNethermind()` function is then defined. This function uses the `systemctl` command to restart the `nethermind.service`. The `sudo` command is used to run the `systemctl` command with root privileges. \n\nAfter the function is defined, it is called to restart the `nethermind.service`. \n\nFinally, a message is printed to the console indicating that the restart was successful. This message is also colored green using the `On_Green` variable. \n\nThis script can be used to automate the process of restarting the `nethermind.service` on a Linux system. It can be integrated into a larger deployment or monitoring system to ensure that the Nethermind Ethereum client is always running. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ ./restart_nethermind.sh\n Restarting the nethermind.service...\n OK\n```",
