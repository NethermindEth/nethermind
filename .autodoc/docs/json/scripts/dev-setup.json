  "summary": "This code is a Bash script that installs dependencies, clones the Nethermind repository, builds the project, and runs the Nethermind node. \n\nThe script starts by updating the package list and installing required dependencies, including the .NET Core SDK, jq, libsnappy-dev, libc6-dev, and moreutils. \n\nNext, the script clones the Nethermind repository and sets up scripts and folders. It copies the pullandbuild.sh and infra.sh scripts to the home directory, creates a src directory, moves the nethermind directory to src, and makes the pullandbuild.sh and infra.sh scripts executable. The pullandbuild.sh script pulls the latest changes from the repository, builds the project, and creates a nethermind executable. The infra.sh script starts the Nethermind node with the specified configuration file. \n\nFinally, the script prompts the user to enter the configuration/s they wish to run, copies the configuration file/s to the home directory, and provides instructions on how to run the node using the screen command and the infra.sh script. \n\nThis script is useful for setting up and running the Nethermind node on a Linux machine. It automates the process of installing dependencies, cloning the repository, building the project, and running the node. It also provides a convenient way to select and run different configurations. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ chmod +x nethermind.sh\n$ ./nethermind.sh\n```",
