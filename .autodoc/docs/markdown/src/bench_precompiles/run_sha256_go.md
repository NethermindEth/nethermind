This code is a shell script that runs a benchmark test for the Go implementation of the SHA256 precompile function in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this benchmark test is to measure the performance of the SHA256 precompile function and compare it to other implementations. 

The script sets the environment variable RAYON_NUM_THREADS to 4, which specifies the number of threads to use for parallel processing. Then, it runs the command "cargo test" with the following options: 
- "--release" specifies that the test should be run with optimizations enabled for release builds
- "--nocapture" specifies that the output of the test should not be captured and should be printed to the console
- "--ignored" specifies that the test should include ignored tests, which in this case is the benchmark test for the SHA256 precompile function

The output of the benchmark test will include metrics such as the number of iterations, total time, and average time per iteration. These metrics can be used to compare the performance of the SHA256 precompile function across different implementations and to identify areas for optimization.

Here is an example of how this script might be used in the larger Nethermind project: 
- A developer working on the SHA256 precompile function wants to optimize its performance
- They run this benchmark test script to measure the current performance of the function and identify areas for improvement
- They make changes to the implementation of the function and run the benchmark test again to see if the changes have improved performance
- They continue iterating on the implementation and running the benchmark test until they are satisfied with the performance of the function.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is likely used to run a benchmark test for the `benchmark_go_sha256_precompile` function using the Rust programming language and the Rayon library with 4 threads.

2. What is the significance of the `--release` and `--ignored` flags?
   - The `--release` flag indicates that the code should be compiled with optimizations for release, while the `--ignored` flag indicates that ignored tests should be run as well.

3. What is the role of the `nocapture` flag?
   - The `--nocapture` flag allows the output of the benchmark test to be printed to the console, rather than being captured and hidden from view.
