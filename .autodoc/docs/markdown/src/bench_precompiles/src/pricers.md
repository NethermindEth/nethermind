The code defines a set of structs and functions that are used to calculate the cost of executing certain operations in the Nethermind project. The `Pricer` enum defines two types of pricers: `ConstantPricer` and `LinearPricer`. The `ConstantPricer` struct has a single field `constant` which is a constant value used to calculate the cost of an operation. The `LinearPricer` struct has five fields: `constant`, `scalar_shift`, `scalar_chunk_size`, `per_chunk`, and `use_ceil_div`. These fields are used to calculate the cost of an operation using a linear function.

The `price` function is defined on the `Pricer` enum and takes a `scalar` value as input. It returns the cost of the operation based on the type of pricer. If the pricer is a `ConstantPricer`, the function returns the constant value. If the pricer is a `LinearPricer`, the function calculates the cost using the linear function defined by the fields of the `LinearPricer` struct.

The code also defines several functions that return instances of the `Pricer` enum. These functions are used to get the current and proposed cost of executing certain operations in the Nethermind project. For example, the `current_sha256_pricer` function returns a `LinearPricer` instance that is used to calculate the cost of executing the SHA256 algorithm in the current version of the project. Similarly, the `proposed_sha256_pricer` function returns a `LinearPricer` instance that is used to calculate the cost of executing the SHA256 algorithm in a proposed version of the project.

Overall, this code is used to calculate the cost of executing certain operations in the Nethermind project. The `Pricer` enum defines two types of pricers: `ConstantPricer` and `LinearPricer`. The `price` function is used to calculate the cost of an operation based on the type of pricer. The other functions are used to get instances of the `Pricer` enum that are used to calculate the cost of executing specific operations in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Pricer` struct and its associated functions?
- The `Pricer` struct is used to calculate the cost of various operations in the Nethermind project. The `price` function takes a scalar value and returns the cost based on the type of `Pricer` (either `ConstantPricer` or `LinearPricer`).

2. What is the difference between `use_ceil_div` and `floor_div` in the `price` function?
- `use_ceil_div` is a boolean flag that determines whether to use ceiling division or floor division when calculating the number of chunks in the `LinearPricer` case. `ceil_div` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `floor_div` rounds down to the nearest integer.

3. What are the different types of `Pricer` functions available in the Nethermind project?
- There are several different `Pricer` functions available, including `current_sha256_pricer`, `proposed_sha256_pricer`, `current_ripemd_pricer`, `proposed_ripemd_pricer`, `current_bnadd_pricer`, `proposed_bnadd_pricer`, `current_bnmul_pricer`, `proposed_bnmul_pricer`, `bnpair_pricer`, and `blake2f_pricer`. Each of these functions returns a `Pricer` struct with different constant and linear values used to calculate the cost of various operations.
