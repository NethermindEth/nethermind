The `CompositeComparerTests` class is a test suite for the `CompositeComparer` class in the Nethermind project. The `CompositeComparer` class is responsible for composing multiple comparers into a single comparer. This is useful when sorting a collection of objects by multiple criteria. 

The `CompositeComparerTests` class contains a single test method called `Composes_correctly`. This method takes a collection of comparers as input and returns a collection of comparers as output. The input collection is used to create a new instance of the `CompositeComparer` class, which is then used to extract the internal comparers. The output collection should contain the same comparers as the input collection, but in the order specified by the `ThenBy` method.

The `ComparersTestCases` property is an IEnumerable that defines a set of test cases for the `Composes_correctly` method. Each test case is defined as a `TestCaseData` object that contains an array of comparers, an array of expected comparers, and a name for the test case. The `BuildTest` method is a helper method that creates a new `TestCaseData` object with the specified parameters.

The `ComparersTestCases` property defines four test cases. The first test case uses three comparers and expects the same three comparers in the output collection. The second test case uses two comparers, where the second comparer is chained to the first using the `ThenBy` method. The expected output collection should contain the same two comparers as the input collection, but with the second comparer appearing before the first. The third test case is similar to the second, but with the order of the comparers reversed. The fourth test case is similar to the second, but with an additional comparer added to the input collection.

The `CompositeComparerTests` class uses the `NSubstitute` and `NUnit.Framework` namespaces to create mock objects and define test cases, respectively. The `NSubstitute` library is used to create mock implementations of the `IComparer<int>` interface, which is used to define the comparers. The `NUnit.Framework` library is used to define the test cases and assert that the output of the `Composes_correctly` method matches the expected output.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the CompositeComparer class and how is it used?
- The CompositeComparer class is used to combine multiple IComparer instances into a single composite comparer. It is used to test whether the comparers are composed correctly.

2. What is the purpose of the ComparersTestCases property and how is it used?
- The ComparersTestCases property is a collection of test cases that are used to test the CompositeComparer class. It is used as the source of test cases for the Composes_correctly method.

3. What is the purpose of the Composes_correctly method and what does it return?
- The Composes_correctly method tests whether the CompositeComparer correctly composes the given comparers. It returns an IEnumerable of IComparer<int> that represents the composed comparers.
