The `LogEntryBuilder` class is a builder pattern implementation for the `LogEntry` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to create instances of the `LogEntry` class for testing purposes. 

The `LogEntry` class represents a log entry in the Ethereum blockchain. It contains information about an event that has occurred in a smart contract, such as the address of the contract, the data associated with the event, and the topics associated with the event. 

The `LogEntryBuilder` class provides methods to set the values of these properties when creating a `LogEntry` instance. The `WithAddress` method sets the address of the contract, the `WithData` method sets the data associated with the event, and the `WithTopics` method sets the topics associated with the event. 

For example, to create a `LogEntry` instance with a specific address, data, and topics, the following code can be used:

```
LogEntry logEntry = new LogEntryBuilder()
    .WithAddress(new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"))
    .WithData(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 })
    .WithTopics(new Keccak("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234"))
    .Build();
```

This code creates a `LogEntry` instance with the specified address, data, and topics. The `Build` method is called at the end to create the `LogEntry` instance with the specified values.

Overall, the `LogEntryBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `LogEntry` class for testing purposes. It simplifies the process of creating `LogEntry` instances with specific values for testing scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LogEntryBuilder` class?
   - The `LogEntryBuilder` class is used to build instances of the `LogEntry` class.
2. What are the default values for `_data` and `_topics`?
   - The default value for `_data` is an empty byte array (`Array.Empty<byte>()`), and the default value for `_topics` is an array containing a single `Keccak` instance (`new[] { Keccak.Zero }`).
3. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
