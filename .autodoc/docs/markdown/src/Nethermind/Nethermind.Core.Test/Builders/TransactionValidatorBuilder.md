[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Core.Test/Builders/TransactionValidatorBuilder.cs)

The code is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for testing purposes. Specifically, it is a builder class that creates instances of the `ITxValidator` interface. The `ITxValidator` interface is used to validate transactions in the transaction pool. The purpose of this builder class is to create instances of `ITxValidator` with specific behavior for testing.

The `TransactionValidatorBuilder` class inherits from the `BuilderBase` class and overrides its `BeforeReturn` method. The `BeforeReturn` method is called before the instance of `ITxValidator` is returned by the builder. In this method, the behavior of the `IsWellFormed` method of the `ITxValidator` interface is set using the `NSubstitute` library. The `IsWellFormed` method takes a `Transaction` object and an `IReleaseSpec` object as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the transaction is well-formed or not. The behavior of the `IsWellFormed` method is set to always return the value of the `_alwaysTrue` field, which is set by calling the `ThatAlwaysReturnsTrue` or `ThatAlwaysReturnsFalse` methods of the builder.

This builder class can be used in unit tests to create instances of `ITxValidator` with specific behavior. For example, if a test case requires an `ITxValidator` instance that always returns `true` for the `IsWellFormed` method, the test case can create an instance of `TransactionValidatorBuilder` and call its `ThatAlwaysReturnsTrue` method before calling its `Build` method to create the `ITxValidator` instance. Similarly, if a test case requires an `ITxValidator` instance that always returns `false` for the `IsWellFormed` method, the test case can create an instance of `TransactionValidatorBuilder` and call its `ThatAlwaysReturnsFalse` method before calling its `Build` method to create the `ITxValidator` instance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file contains a class called `TransactionValidatorBuilder` which is used to build an object of type `ITxValidator` for testing purposes.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
   - This code file depends on `Nethermind.Core.Specs`, `Nethermind.TxPool`, and `NSubstitute` namespaces.

3. What is the functionality of the `ThatAlwaysReturnsFalse` and `ThatAlwaysReturnsTrue` properties?
   - These properties set a private boolean `_alwaysTrue` to either `false` or `true`, respectively, which is then used to determine the return value of the `IsWellFormed` method of the `ITxValidator` object being built.
