The `ReceiptBuilder` class is a builder for creating instances of the `TxReceipt` class. The `TxReceipt` class represents the receipt of a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The receipt contains information about the transaction, such as the amount of gas used, the sender and recipient addresses, and any logs generated by the transaction.

The `ReceiptBuilder` class provides methods for setting the various fields of the `TxReceipt` class. These methods allow the user to create a `TxReceipt` object with specific values for each field. For example, the `WithSender` method sets the sender address of the receipt, while the `WithGasUsed` method sets the amount of gas used by the transaction.

The `ReceiptBuilder` class also provides a `WithAllFieldsFilled` property, which sets all the fields of the `TxReceipt` object to non-default values. This property can be used to quickly create a `TxReceipt` object with all fields filled for testing purposes.

The `ReceiptBuilder` class uses the `BuilderBase` class as a base class. The `BuilderBase` class provides a `TestObjectInternal` property, which is the object being built by the builder. The `TestObjectInternal` property is used to set the fields of the `TxReceipt` object being built.

Overall, the `ReceiptBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `TxReceipt` class with specific values for each field. This is useful for testing and other scenarios where a `TxReceipt` object needs to be created with specific values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReceiptBuilder` class?
- The `ReceiptBuilder` class is used to build instances of `TxReceipt` objects for testing purposes.

2. What is the significance of the `WithAllFieldsFilled` property?
- The `WithAllFieldsFilled` property sets all the fields of the `TxReceipt` object to non-default values for testing purposes.

3. What is the purpose of the `WithCalculatedBloom` method?
- The `WithCalculatedBloom` method calculates the bloom filter for the `TxReceipt` object based on its logs.
