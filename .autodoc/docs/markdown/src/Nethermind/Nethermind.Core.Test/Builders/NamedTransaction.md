The code above defines a class called `NamedTransaction` that inherits from another class called `Transaction`. The purpose of this class is to add a `Name` property to the `Transaction` class, which can be used to give a name or label to a transaction object. 

The `NamedTransaction` class also overrides the `ToString()` method to return the value of the `Name` property. This means that when the `ToString()` method is called on a `NamedTransaction` object, it will return the name of the transaction as a string.

The `[DebuggerDisplay(nameof(Name))]` attribute is used to provide a display string for the Visual Studio debugger. This means that when a `NamedTransaction` object is being debugged in Visual Studio, the debugger will display the value of the `Name` property instead of the default display string.

This class is located in the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace, which suggests that it is used for testing purposes. It may be used to create test transactions with specific names or labels, which can be useful for testing transaction-related functionality in the larger Nethermind project.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a test:

```csharp
NamedTransaction transaction = new NamedTransaction
{
    Name = "Test Transaction",
    // set other properties of the transaction as needed
};

// perform some tests on the transaction object
Assert.AreEqual("Test Transaction", transaction.ToString());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NamedTransaction` class?
   - The `NamedTransaction` class is a subclass of `Transaction` and adds a `Name` property and a `ToString()` method that returns the name.

2. Why is the `Name` property initialized to `null!`?
   - The `null!` initialization is used to indicate that the property will never be null during runtime, even though it is not assigned a value at compile time.

3. What is the purpose of the `[DebuggerDisplay(nameof(Name))]` attribute?
   - The `[DebuggerDisplay]` attribute is used to customize the display of the object in the debugger. In this case, it will display the value of the `Name` property when debugging.
