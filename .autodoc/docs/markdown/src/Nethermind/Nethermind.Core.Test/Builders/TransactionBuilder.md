The `TransactionBuilder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to build transactions. It is a generic class that can be used to build any type of transaction that inherits from the `Transaction` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to create transactions with specific properties.

The `TransactionBuilder` class has a constructor that initializes a new instance of the transaction with default values for the gas price, gas limit, to address, nonce, value, data, and timestamp. The class provides a number of methods that can be used to set specific properties of the transaction, such as the nonce, to address, data, gas price, gas limit, and value. 

The class also provides methods to set the access list, sender address, and signature of the transaction. Additionally, there are methods to sign the transaction using an Ethereum Ecdsa object and a private key, and to set the transaction type and whether it is a service transaction.

The `TransactionBuilder` class is useful in the larger Nethermind project because it provides a convenient way to create transactions with specific properties. This is particularly useful for testing purposes, where transactions with specific properties may need to be created in order to test specific scenarios. 

For example, the following code creates a new instance of the `TransactionBuilder` class and sets the to address, value, and data properties of the transaction:

```
var builder = new TransactionBuilder<Transaction>();
var transaction = builder
    .To(new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"))
    .WithValue(1000)
    .WithData(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 })
    .Build();
```

This code creates a new transaction with a to address of `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`, a value of 1000 wei, and data of `0x010203`. The `Build` method is called to create the transaction object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a TransactionBuilder class that provides methods for building and modifying transactions.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and namespaces, including Nethermind.Core.Crypto, Nethermind.Core.Eip2930, Nethermind.Crypto, Nethermind.Int256, and Nethermind.Logging.

3. What is the significance of the SignedAndResolved method?
- The SignedAndResolved method signs the transaction using the provided private key and resolves the sender address. It ensures that the transaction is not modified after signing to prevent a different recovered address.
