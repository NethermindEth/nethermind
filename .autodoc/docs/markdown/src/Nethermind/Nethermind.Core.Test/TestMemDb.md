The `TestMemDb` class is a subclass of the `MemDb` class, which is a memory-based key-value store. The purpose of this class is to provide additional tools for testing purposes, as it is not possible to use NSubstitute with refstruct. 

The class has several properties and methods that allow for tracking of read, write, and remove operations on the database. The `_readKeys`, `_writeKeys`, and `_removedKeys` fields are lists that keep track of the keys that have been read, written, and removed, respectively. 

The `ReadFunc` and `RemoveFunc` properties are delegates that can be set to custom functions that will be called instead of the default `Get` and `Remove` methods. This allows for custom behavior to be injected into the database during testing. 

The `this` property is overridden to add the current key to the `_writeKeys` list before calling the base implementation. The `Get` method is also overridden to add the current key and flags to the `_readKeys` list before calling the base implementation or the custom `ReadFunc`, if it is set. The `Remove` method is overridden to add the current key to the `_removedKeys` list before calling the base implementation or the custom `RemoveFunc`, if it is set. 

The `KeyWasRead`, `KeyWasReadWithFlags`, `KeyWasWritten`, and `KeyWasRemoved` methods are used to assert that certain keys have been read, written, or removed the expected number of times. These methods take a key and an optional number of times that the key should have been accessed. 

Finally, the `StartBatch` method is overridden to return an `InMemoryBatch` instance, which is a subclass of `Batch` that operates on an in-memory dictionary. 

Overall, the `TestMemDb` class provides a way to test code that interacts with a key-value store by allowing for tracking of read, write, and remove operations, as well as custom behavior injection. It is a useful tool for testing code that uses the `MemDb` class or any other key-value store that implements the same interface. 

Example usage:

```csharp
[Test]
public void TestMemDb_ReadFunc()
{
    var db = new TestMemDb();
    db.ReadFunc = key => Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("test");

    var result = db.Get(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("key"));

    result.Should().BeEquivalentTo(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("test"));
    db.KeyWasRead(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("key"));
}

[Test]
public void TestMemDb_RemoveFunc()
{
    var db = new TestMemDb();
    db.RemoveFunc = key => { /* do nothing */ };

    db.Remove(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("key"));

    db.KeyWasRemoved(key => Bytes.AreEqual(key, Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("key")));
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `TestMemDb` which is a subclass of `MemDb` and provides additional tools for testing purposes.

2. What are the additional tools provided by this class?
- The class provides tools to track read, write, and remove operations on the database, as well as the ability to set custom read and remove functions.

3. What is the purpose of the `StartBatch` method?
- The `StartBatch` method returns a new instance of `InMemoryBatch`, which is an implementation of the `IBatch` interface and provides a way to group multiple database operations into a single atomic transaction.
