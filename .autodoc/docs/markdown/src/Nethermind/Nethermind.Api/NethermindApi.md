The `NethermindApi` class is a central component of the Nethermind project, which provides a set of APIs for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It contains a large number of properties and methods that are used to configure and manage various aspects of the blockchain node.

One of the key methods in this class is `CreateBlockchainBridge()`, which creates a new instance of the `BlockchainBridge` class. This class is responsible for processing transactions, validating blocks, and managing the state of the blockchain. It takes a number of dependencies as constructor arguments, including a read-only database provider, a transaction pool, a receipt finder, and a filter manager.

The `NethermindApi` class also contains a number of other properties and methods that are used to configure and manage different components of the blockchain node. For example, it contains properties for managing the block tree, the block validator, the transaction pool, and the key store. It also contains methods for creating instances of various other classes, such as the `AbiEncoder` and the `MessageSerializationService`.

Overall, the `NethermindApi` class serves as a central point of configuration and management for the Nethermind blockchain node. It provides a set of APIs that can be used to interact with the blockchain, and it manages the various components that make up the node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NethermindApi` class?
