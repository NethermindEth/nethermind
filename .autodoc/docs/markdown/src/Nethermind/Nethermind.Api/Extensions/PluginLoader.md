The `PluginLoader` class is responsible for loading and ordering plugins for the Nethermind project. It implements the `IPluginLoader` interface and has two main methods: `Load` and `OrderPlugins`. 

The `Load` method loads plugins from two sources: embedded plugins and external plugin assemblies. Embedded plugins are passed as a parameter to the constructor, while external plugin assemblies are loaded from a specified directory. The method first loads all embedded plugins and then loads all assemblies from the specified directory. For each assembly, it loads all exported types that implement the `INethermindPlugin` interface and adds them to the list of plugin types. 

The `OrderPlugins` method orders the list of plugin types based on a specified plugin order. The order is specified in the `IPluginConfig` parameter passed to the method. The method first sorts the list of plugin types based on whether they implement the `IConsensusPlugin` interface or not. Consensus plugins are always placed at the front of the list. Then, it sorts the list based on the specified plugin order. If a plugin is not in the specified order, it is placed after all plugins that are in the order. 

The `PluginLoader` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to load and order plugins. It is used by the `PluginManager` class, which is responsible for managing plugins. The `PluginManager` class uses the `PluginLoader` class to load and order plugins, and then initializes and starts each plugin. 

Example usage:
```
// Create a new PluginLoader instance
PluginLoader pluginLoader = new PluginLoader("plugins", new FileSystem());

// Load plugins
pluginLoader.Load(logManager);

// Order plugins
pluginLoader.OrderPlugins(pluginConfig);

// Get the list of plugin types
IEnumerable<Type> pluginTypes = pluginLoader.PluginTypes;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PluginLoader` class?
    
    The `PluginLoader` class is responsible for loading and ordering plugins from a specified directory and embedded types.

2. What is the significance of the `IPluginLoader` interface?
    
    The `IPluginLoader` interface is not shown in this code, but it is likely implemented by the `PluginLoader` class. It is possible that other classes may also implement this interface, and it likely defines a set of methods or properties that must be implemented by any class that wants to act as a plugin loader.

3. What is the purpose of the `OrderPlugins` method?
    
    The `OrderPlugins` method is responsible for ordering the loaded plugins based on a specified configuration. It sorts the plugins based on whether they are consensus plugins or not, and then based on their position in the specified plugin order.
