The `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class is a test suite for testing the functionality of the `SocketClient` class, which is a part of the Nethermind project. The `SocketClient` class is responsible for handling WebSocket connections and processing JSON-RPC messages received over the WebSocket connection.

The `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class contains several test methods that test different aspects of the `SocketClient` class. The `Can_receive_whole_message` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class can receive a complete JSON-RPC message that is split across multiple WebSocket frames. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that sends three WebSocket frames, each containing a part of the JSON-RPC message. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the message and verify that the complete message has been received.

The `Updates_Metrics_And_Stats_Successfully` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class updates the metrics and statistics correctly when processing JSON-RPC messages. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that sends a single JSON-RPC message. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the message and verify that the metrics and statistics have been updated correctly.

The `Can_receive_many_messages` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class can receive multiple JSON-RPC messages sent over the WebSocket connection. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that sends 1000 JSON-RPC messages. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the messages and verify that all the messages have been received.

The `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class can receive a complete JSON-RPC message that is split across multiple WebSocket frames of non-buffer sizes. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that sends six WebSocket frames, each containing a part of the JSON-RPC message. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the message and verify that the complete message has been received.

The `Throws_on_too_long_message` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class throws an exception when it receives a JSON-RPC message that is too long. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that sends 1024 WebSocket frames, each containing a part of a very long JSON-RPC message. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the message and verify that an exception is thrown.

The `Stops_on_dirty_disconnect` method tests whether the `SocketClient` class stops processing JSON-RPC messages when the WebSocket connection is closed abruptly. The test creates a mock WebSocket connection that throws an exception when the `ReceiveAsync` method is called. The `SocketClient` class is then used to receive the message, and the test verifies that the `ReceiveAsync` method does not hang indefinitely.

Overall, the `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class tests the functionality of the `SocketClient` class and ensures that it can handle WebSocket connections and process JSON-RPC messages correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class?
- The `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class is a test class that contains several unit tests for testing the behavior of the `SocketClient` class when receiving WebSocket messages.

2. What is the purpose of the `WebSocketMock` class?
- The `WebSocketMock` class is a mock implementation of the `WebSocket` class that is used in the unit tests to simulate receiving WebSocket messages.

3. What is the purpose of the `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` test?
- The `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` test is a unit test that verifies that the `SocketClient` class can correctly receive and process WebSocket messages that are not a multiple of the buffer size.
