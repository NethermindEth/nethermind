The `Blake2Benchmark` class is a benchmarking tool for the Blake2 hash function implementation in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this code is to compare the performance of the current implementation of the Blake2 hash function with an improved version. 

The `Blake2Benchmark` class uses the `BenchmarkDotNet` library to run benchmarks on the `Current()` and `Improved()` methods. The `GlobalSetup` method is used to ensure that the output of the `Current()` and `Improved()` methods are equal. If they are not equal, an `InvalidBenchmarkDeclarationException` is thrown.

The `Current()` and `Improved()` methods both take a `byte[]` input and return a `Span<byte>` output. The `Span<byte>` type is a lightweight representation of a contiguous region of memory that can be used to avoid unnecessary copying of data. 

The `Current()` and `Improved()` methods both create a new `byte[]` of length 64 to store the output of the hash function. They then call the `Compress()` method of the `Blake2Compression` class to compute the hash of the input. The `Compress()` method updates the `result` array with the computed hash value. Finally, the `result` array is returned as a `Span<byte>`.

The `Benchmark` attribute is used to mark the `Current()` method as the baseline method and the `Improved()` method as the method being improved. The `BenchmarkDotNet` library will run both methods and report the time taken to execute each method.

Overall, this code is a benchmarking tool that can be used to compare the performance of different implementations of the Blake2 hash function in the Nethermind project. The `Blake2Benchmark` class can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the implementation of the hash function.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a benchmark for the Blake2Compression algorithm used in Nethermind's EVM.

2. What is the difference between the `Current` and `Improved` methods?
   - Both methods use the same `_blake2Compression` object to compress the `input` byte array and return a `Span<byte>` result. The `Current` method is marked as the baseline for the benchmark, while the `Improved` method is not.

3. What is the purpose of the `Setup` method?
   - The `Setup` method checks if the `Current` and `Improved` methods return the same result using the `Bytes.AreEqual` method. If they do not, it throws an `InvalidBenchmarkDeclarationException` with the message "blakes".
