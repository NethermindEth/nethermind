The code defines an interface called `ICliqueRpcModule` that extends `IRpcModule` and is annotated with `[RpcModule(ModuleType.Clique)]`. This interface contains several methods that can be used to interact with the Clique consensus algorithm in the Nethermind project via JSON-RPC.

The `clique_getBlockSigner` method retrieves the signer of a block with a given hash. It takes a `Keccak` hash as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an optional `Address` (the signer) or an error if the block with the given hash does not exist.

The `clique_getSnapshot` method retrieves a snapshot of the current Clique state. It returns a `ResultWrapper` containing a `Snapshot` object.

The `clique_getSnapshotAtHash` method retrieves a snapshot of the Clique state at a given block. It takes a `Keccak` hash as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing a `Snapshot` object.

The `clique_getSigners` method retrieves the list of authorized signers in the current Clique state. It returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an array of `Address` objects.

The `clique_getSignersAtHash` method retrieves the list of authorized signers at a given block. It takes a `Keccak` hash as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an array of `Address` objects.

The `clique_getSignersAtNumber` method retrieves the list of authorized signers at a given block number. It takes a `long` number as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an array of `Address` objects.

The `clique_getSignersAnnotated` method retrieves the list of authorized signers in the current Clique state, but with signer names instead of addresses. It returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an array of `string` objects.

The `clique_getSignersAtHashAnnotated` method retrieves the list of authorized signers at a given block, but with signer names instead of addresses. It takes a `Keccak` hash as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing an array of `string` objects.

The `clique_propose` method adds a new authorization proposal that the signer will attempt to push through. It takes an `Address` and a `bool` vote as input. If the `vote` parameter is `true`, the local signer votes for the given address to be included in the set of authorized signers. With `vote` set to `false`, the signer is against the address. It returns a `ResultWrapper` containing a `bool` indicating whether the proposal was successfully added.

The `clique_discard` method drops a currently running proposal. The signer will not cast further votes (either for or against) the address. It takes an `Address` as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing a `bool` indicating whether the proposal was successfully discarded.

The `clique_produceBlock` method forces the Clique block producer to produce a new block. It takes a `Keccak` parent hash as input and returns a `ResultWrapper` containing a `bool` indicating whether the block was successfully produced.

Overall, this code provides a set of methods that can be used to interact with the Clique consensus algorithm in the Nethermind project via JSON-RPC. These methods allow for retrieving information about the current Clique state, as well as adding and discarding authorization proposals and forcing the production of new blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines an interface called `ICliqueRpcModule` that contains several JSON-RPC methods related to the Clique consensus algorithm.

2. What is the role of the `RpcModule` attribute?
- The `RpcModule` attribute is used to specify the type of module that this interface belongs to, in this case `ModuleType.Clique`. This is used by the JSON-RPC server to group related methods together.

3. What is the purpose of the `ResultWrapper` class?
- The `ResultWrapper` class is used to wrap the return value of each JSON-RPC method in a standardized format that includes additional metadata such as whether the method was implemented or not.
