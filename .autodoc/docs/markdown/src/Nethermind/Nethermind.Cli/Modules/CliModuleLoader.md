The `CliModuleLoader` class is responsible for loading and discovering CLI modules in the Nethermind project. It is used to load modules that are used in the command-line interface (CLI) of the Nethermind client. 

The `CliModuleLoader` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: an `ICliEngine` instance, an `IJsonRpcClient` instance, and an `ICliConsole` instance. These parameters are used to initialize the class fields. 

The `CliModuleLoader` class has two public properties: `ModuleNames` and `MethodsByModules`. `ModuleNames` is a list of strings that contains the names of the loaded modules. `MethodsByModules` is a dictionary that maps module names to a list of method names. 

The `CliModuleLoader` class has several private methods that are used to load and discover modules. The `DiscoverAndLoadModules` method is used to discover and load modules. It searches for all DLLs that match the pattern "Nethermind*.dll" in the application directory and the "plugins" directory. It then loads all exported types that inherit from `CliModuleBase` and are marked with the `CliModuleAttribute`. 

The `LoadModule` method is used to load a single module. It takes a `CliModuleBase` instance as a parameter and loads all public methods that are decorated with the `CliPropertyAttribute` or `CliFunctionAttribute`. It then creates a delegate for each method and adds it to an `ObjectInstance` that is associated with the module. 

The `CreateDelegate` method is used to create a delegate for a method. It takes a `MethodInfo` instance and a `CliModuleBase` instance as parameters. It then creates an array of `Type` objects that represent the method's parameter types and return type. It uses this array to create a delegate that can be used to invoke the method. 

The `AddMethod` and `AddProperty` methods are used to add methods and properties to an `ObjectInstance`. They take an `ObjectInstance`, a name, and a `DelegateWrapper` instance as parameters. They then add the method or property to the `ObjectInstance`. 

Overall, the `CliModuleLoader` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's CLI. It is responsible for discovering and loading modules that provide additional functionality to the CLI. It uses reflection to discover and load modules, and it creates delegates to invoke the methods provided by the modules.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CliModuleLoader` class?
- The `CliModuleLoader` class is responsible for discovering and loading CLI modules, and creating delegates for their methods.

2. What is the `CreateDelegate` method used for?
- The `CreateDelegate` method is used to create a delegate for a given method of a CLI module, which can be used to invoke the method later.

3. What is the purpose of the `DiscoverAndLoadModules` method?
- The `DiscoverAndLoadModules` method is used to discover and load all available CLI modules, including those in external DLLs, and add their methods and properties to the console interface.
