The `SystemCliModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project's command-line interface (CLI) that provides functionality related to system information. The purpose of this module is to allow users to retrieve system information and statistics through the CLI. 

The class is decorated with the `[CliModule("system")]` attribute, which indicates that it is a CLI module with the name "system". The class inherits from `CliModuleBase`, which provides a base implementation for CLI modules. 

The `GetVariable` method is decorated with the `[CliFunction("system", "getVariable")]` attribute, which indicates that it is a CLI function with the name "getVariable" in the "system" module. This method takes two string parameters, `name` and `defaultValue`, and returns a string. The method retrieves the value of an environment variable with the name specified in the `name` parameter using the `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` method. If the value is null or whitespace, it returns the `defaultValue` parameter. 

The `Memory` method is decorated with the `[CliProperty("system", "memory")]` attribute, which indicates that it is a CLI property with the name "memory" in the "system" module. This method takes two string parameters, `name` and `defaultValue`, and returns a string. The method returns a formatted string that contains information about the memory usage and garbage collection statistics of the application. It uses the `GC.GetTotalMemory` and `GC.CollectionCount` methods to retrieve the relevant information. 

The constructor for the `SystemCliModule` class takes two parameters, `cliEngine` and `nodeManager`, which are interfaces for the CLI engine and node manager, respectively. These parameters are passed to the base constructor of `CliModuleBase`. 

Overall, the `SystemCliModule` class provides a convenient way for users to retrieve system information and statistics through the Nethermind CLI. For example, a user could use the following command to retrieve the value of an environment variable named "MY_VAR" with a default value of "default": 

```
> system getVariable MY_VAR default
```

Similarly, a user could use the following command to retrieve memory usage and garbage collection statistics: 

```
> system memory
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a CLI module for the Nethermind project that provides functions and properties related to system information.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released and is used to ensure license compliance and tracking.

3. What is the role of the ICliEngine and INodeManager interfaces in the SystemCliModule constructor?
   - The ICliEngine and INodeManager interfaces are dependencies that are injected into the SystemCliModule constructor and are used by the base class CliModuleBase to provide functionality for the CLI module.
