The code above defines a custom attribute class called `CliFunctionAttribute` that can be used to annotate methods in the Nethermind project's command-line interface (CLI) modules. 

The `CliFunctionAttribute` class has several properties that can be used to provide additional information about the annotated method. These properties include `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`. 

The `ObjectName` and `FunctionName` properties are required and are used to specify the name of the object and function that the annotated method represents. The `Description` property is an optional string that can be used to provide a brief description of what the method does. The `ResponseDescription` property is also an optional string that can be used to describe the format of the response that the method returns. Finally, the `ExampleResponse` property is an optional string that can be used to provide an example of what the response might look like.

By using the `CliFunctionAttribute` class to annotate methods in the CLI modules, developers can provide additional information about the methods that can be used by other developers or users of the Nethermind project. For example, the `ToString()` method in the `CliFunctionAttribute` class can be used to generate a string representation of the annotated method that includes the object name, function name, and description. 

Here is an example of how the `CliFunctionAttribute` class might be used to annotate a method in a CLI module:

```
[CliFunction("myobject", "myfunction", Description = "This is my function")]
public void MyFunction()
{
    // Method implementation
}
```

In this example, the `MyFunction()` method is annotated with the `CliFunctionAttribute` class, specifying that it represents the `myfunction` function in the `myobject` object. The `Description` property is also set to provide a brief description of what the method does.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom attribute called `CliFunctionAttribute` that can be used to annotate methods in a CLI module.

2. What properties does the `CliFunctionAttribute` class have?
   The `CliFunctionAttribute` class has properties for `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToString()` method in the `CliFunctionAttribute` class?
   The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the `CliFunctionAttribute` instance, including the `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, and `Description` properties (if present).
