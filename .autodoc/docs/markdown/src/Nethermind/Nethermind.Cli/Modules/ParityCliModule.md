The code represents a module called `ParityCliModule` that is part of the Nethermind project. The module is responsible for providing a set of command-line interface (CLI) functions and properties related to the Parity client. The module is implemented as a C# class that inherits from `CliModuleBase` and is decorated with the `[CliModule("parity")]` attribute, which specifies the name of the module.

The module provides several CLI functions and properties that can be used to interact with the Parity client. These functions and properties are decorated with the `[CliFunction]` and `[CliProperty]` attributes, respectively, which specify the name and description of the function or property.

The `PendingTransactions` function returns the pending transactions using the Parity format. The `GetBlockReceipts` function returns the receipts from all transactions from a particular block. The `Enode` property returns the node enode URI. The `ClearSigner` function clears an authority account for signing consensus messages, and the `SetSigner` and `SetEngineSignerSecret` functions set an authority account for signing consensus messages. Finally, the `NetPeers` property returns connected peers with non-empty protocols that have completed the handshake.

The module is designed to be used with the Nethermind CLI engine, which is responsible for parsing and executing CLI commands. The engine is passed to the module's constructor along with an `INodeManager` instance, which is used to communicate with the Parity client.

Here is an example of how the `PendingTransactions` function can be used:

```
> parity pendingTransactions
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "hash": "0x123456...",
      "from": "0xabcdef...",
      "to": "0x987654...",
      "value": "1000000000000000000",
      "gas": "21000",
      "gasPrice": "5000000000",
      "input": "0xabcdef..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Overall, the `ParityCliModule` module provides a convenient way to interact with the Parity client using the Nethermind CLI engine.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ParityCliModule` class?
- The `ParityCliModule` class is a CLI module that provides functions and properties related to Parity, a client for the Ethereum network.

2. What is the `NodeManager` object and where does it come from?
- The `NodeManager` object is an instance of the `INodeManager` interface, which is passed to the `ParityCliModule` constructor. It is used to interact with the Ethereum node.

3. What is the `CliFunction` attribute used for?
- The `CliFunction` attribute is used to mark a method as a CLI function that can be called from the command line. It takes two arguments: the name of the module and the name of the function, and an optional description.
