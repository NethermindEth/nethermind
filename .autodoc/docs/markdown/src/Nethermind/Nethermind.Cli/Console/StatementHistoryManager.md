The `StatementHistoryManager` class is responsible for managing the command history of the Nethermind CLI console. It is used to keep track of the commands that have been executed in the console and to persist them to a file. The class is also responsible for loading the command history from the file when the console is started.

The `UpdateHistory` method is called every time a command is executed in the console. It takes the command as an argument and adds it to the command history if it is not a secured command. Secured commands are those that contain sensitive information, such as passwords or private keys. If a secured command is executed, the method adds a special string to the command history instead of the actual command. The command history is persisted to a file using the `AppendAllLines` method of the `File` class.

The `Init` method is called when the console is started. It loads the command history from the file and adds it to the console's history buffer using the `AddHistory` method of the `ReadLine` class. The method only loads the last 60 lines of the command history file to avoid loading too much data into memory.

The `StatementHistoryManager` class is used by the Nethermind CLI console to manage the command history. It ensures that the command history is persisted to a file and loaded when the console is started. The class also provides a mechanism for excluding secured commands from the command history to prevent sensitive information from being stored in the file. 

Example usage:

```csharp
var console = new CliConsole();
var fileSystem = new FileSystem();
var historyManager = new StatementHistoryManager(console, fileSystem);

historyManager.Init();

// Execute a command
historyManager.UpdateHistory("eth_getBalance 0x1234567890abcdef");

// Execute a secured command
historyManager.UpdateHistory("unlockAccount 0x1234567890abcdef");

// Load the command history from the file
historyManager.Init();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StatementHistoryManager` class?
- The `StatementHistoryManager` class is responsible for managing the command history of the CLI console.

2. What is the significance of the `SecuredCommands` property?
- The `SecuredCommands` property is a list of commands that should not be saved in the command history for security reasons.

3. What happens if there is an error while writing or loading the command history?
- If there is an error while writing or loading the command history, an error message is printed to the console. If the error occurs while writing, the error message is only printed once to avoid spamming the console.
