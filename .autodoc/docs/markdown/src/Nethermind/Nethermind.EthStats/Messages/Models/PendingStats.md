[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.EthStats/Messages/Models/PendingStats.cs)

The code above defines a class called `PendingStats` within the `Nethermind.EthStats.Messages.Models` namespace. This class has a single property called `Pending` which is an integer value representing the number of pending transactions. The constructor for this class takes an integer parameter which is used to set the value of the `Pending` property.

This class is likely used to represent statistics related to pending transactions within the Nethermind project. It provides a simple way to encapsulate this data and pass it around within the codebase. For example, it could be used in conjunction with other classes to generate reports or visualizations of pending transaction data.

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```
// Create a new PendingStats object with a pending transaction count of 10
PendingStats stats = new PendingStats(10);

// Output the pending transaction count
Console.WriteLine($"There are {stats.Pending} pending transactions.");
```

This would output the following:

```
There are 10 pending transactions.
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to represent pending transaction statistics within the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PendingStats` class?
- The `PendingStats` class is a model for storing pending statistics related to Ethereum transactions.

2. Why is the `Pending` property read-only?
- The `Pending` property is read-only to ensure that the value of `Pending` cannot be modified after it has been set during object initialization.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
- The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
