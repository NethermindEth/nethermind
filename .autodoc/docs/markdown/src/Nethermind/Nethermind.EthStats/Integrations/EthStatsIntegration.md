The `EthStatsIntegration` class is responsible for integrating Nethermind with the EthStats service. EthStats is a service that provides real-time statistics and monitoring for Ethereum nodes. The class implements the `IEthStatsIntegration` interface and contains methods for sending various messages to the EthStats service.

The constructor takes in several parameters, including the name of the node, the network it is running on, and various objects such as the `ITxPool`, `IBlockTree`, and `IPeerManager`. These objects are used to gather information about the node's state and send it to the EthStats service.

The `InitAsync` method initializes the integration by creating a timer that sends statistics to the EthStats service at regular intervals. It also sets up event handlers for new block events and WebSocket reconnection events.

The `SendHelloAsync` method sends a "hello" message to the EthStats service when the integration is first initialized. This message contains information about the node, such as its name, network, and contact information.

The `SendBlockAsync` method sends a message to the EthStats service whenever a new block is added to the blockchain. This message contains information about the block, such as its number, hash, and transactions.

The `SendPendingAsync` method sends a message to the EthStats service with the number of pending transactions in the node's transaction pool.

The `SendStatsAsync` method sends a message to the EthStats service with various statistics about the node, such as the number of active peers, the gas price estimate, and whether the node is currently syncing or mining.

Overall, the `EthStatsIntegration` class provides a way for Nethermind nodes to integrate with the EthStats service and provide real-time statistics and monitoring.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a C# implementation of an integration with the Ethereum network statistics service called EthStats. It sends various messages to EthStats, such as block and pending transaction information, and receives reconnection and disconnection events.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has several external dependencies, including Nethermind.Blockchain, Nethermind.Core, Nethermind.EthStats.Messages, Nethermind.Facade.Eth, Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Eth.GasPrice, and Websocket.Client. It also uses various system libraries such as System and System.Runtime.InteropServices.

3. What is the purpose of the `GasPriceOracle` and how is it used in this code?
- The `GasPriceOracle` is used to estimate the gas price for transactions. It is used in the `SendStatsAsync` method to get the gas price estimate and send it to EthStats as part of the statistics message. If the gas price is greater than the maximum value of a long, it is truncated to long.MaxValue.
