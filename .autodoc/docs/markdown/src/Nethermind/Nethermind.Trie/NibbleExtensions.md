The `Nibbles` class is a utility class that provides methods for converting between byte arrays and nibble arrays. Nibbles are 4-bit values, and this class provides methods for converting between byte arrays and nibble arrays, as well as between nibble arrays and compact hex-encoded byte arrays.

The `FromBytes` method takes a byte array and returns a nibble array. It does this by iterating over the bytes in the input array, and for each byte, it creates two nibbles by masking the high and low 4 bits of the byte. The resulting nibble array is twice the length of the input byte array.

The `BytesToNibbleBytes` method takes two spans of bytes, one representing the input bytes and the other representing the output nibbles. It converts the input bytes to nibbles in the same way as the `FromBytes` method, but instead of returning a nibble array, it writes the nibbles to the output span.

The `FromHexString` method takes a hex string and returns a nibble array. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input string, and for each character, it creates a nibble by parsing the character as a hex digit. The resulting nibble array is the same length as the input string.

The `ToPackedByteArray` method takes a nibble array and returns a byte array. It does this by iterating over the nibbles in the input array, and for each pair of nibbles, it creates a byte by combining the high and low nibbles. The resulting byte array is half the length of the input nibble array.

The `ToByte` method takes two nibbles and returns a byte by combining the high and low nibbles.

The `ToBytes` method takes a nibble array and returns a byte array. It does this by iterating over the nibbles in the input array, and for each pair of nibbles, it creates a byte by combining the high and low nibbles. The resulting byte array is half the length of the input nibble array.

The `ToCompactHexEncoding` method takes a nibble array and returns a compact hex-encoded byte array. It does this by iterating over the nibbles in the input array, and for each pair of nibbles, it creates a byte by combining the high and low nibbles. The resulting byte array is half the length of the input nibble array plus one, and the first byte is a flag indicating whether the input nibble array has an odd or even length.

Overall, the `Nibbles` class provides a set of utility methods for converting between byte arrays, nibble arrays, and compact hex-encoded byte arrays. These methods are used throughout the Nethermind project to work with trie nodes, which are stored as nibble arrays.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nibbles` class?
    
    The `Nibbles` class provides methods for converting between byte arrays and nibble arrays, as well as for encoding and decoding nibble arrays.

2. What is the purpose of the `FromBytes` method?
    
    The `FromBytes` method converts an array of bytes into an array of nibbles, where each byte is split into two nibbles.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToCompactHexEncoding` method?
    
    The `ToCompactHexEncoding` method encodes a nibble array as a byte array using a compact hex encoding, where each pair of nibbles is encoded as a single byte. If the nibble array has an odd length, the first byte of the resulting byte array is set to 0x10 plus the value of the first nibble.
