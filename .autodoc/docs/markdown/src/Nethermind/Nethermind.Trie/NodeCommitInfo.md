The `NodeCommitInfo` struct is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the Trie module. The purpose of this struct is to provide information about a TrieNode that is being committed to the database. 

The struct has two constructors, one that takes a `TrieNode` and another that takes a `TrieNode`, `nodeParent`, and `childPositionAtParent`. The first constructor is used when the node being committed is the root node, and the second constructor is used when the node being committed is a child node. 

The struct has three properties: `Node`, `NodeParent`, and `ChildPositionAtParent`. `Node` is the node being committed, `NodeParent` is the parent of the node being committed, and `ChildPositionAtParent` is the position of the node being committed in its parent's child array. 

The struct also has two boolean properties: `IsEmptyBlockMarker` and `IsRoot`. `IsEmptyBlockMarker` is true if the node being committed is a null node, which is used as a marker for empty blocks in the Trie. `IsRoot` is true if the node being committed is the root node of the Trie. 

The `ToString` method of the struct returns a string representation of the `NodeCommitInfo` object. The string contains the name of the struct, the `Node` property, and either "root" or "child x of y" depending on whether the node being committed is the root node or a child node. 

This struct is used in the Trie module to provide information about nodes being committed to the database. It is particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes, as it provides detailed information about the node being committed and its position in the Trie. 

Example usage:

```
TrieNode node = new TrieNode();
TrieNode parent = new TrieNode();
int position = 0;
NodeCommitInfo commitInfo = new NodeCommitInfo(node, parent, position);
Console.WriteLine(commitInfo.ToString());
// Output: [NodeCommitInfo|<node>|child 0 of <parent>]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the NodeCommitInfo struct?
    
    The NodeCommitInfo struct is used to store information about a TrieNode that is being committed to the trie.

2. What is the significance of the ChildPositionAtParent property?
    
    The ChildPositionAtParent property indicates the position of the TrieNode within its parent node's children array.

3. What is the purpose of the IsRoot property?
    
    The IsRoot property is used to determine whether the TrieNode is the root node of the trie.
