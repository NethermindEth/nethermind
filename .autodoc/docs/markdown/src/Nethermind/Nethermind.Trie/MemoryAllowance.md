The `MemoryAllowance` class is a utility class that provides a way to manage the memory allowance for the trie node cache in the Nethermind project. The trie node cache is a data structure used to store trie nodes in memory, which can be accessed quickly and efficiently. 

The `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property is a static property that represents the amount of memory allocated for the trie node cache. By default, it is set to 128 megabytes (128.MB()), but it can be changed at runtime to adjust the memory allocation as needed. 

The `TrieNodeCacheCount` property is a static property that calculates the number of trie nodes that can be stored in the cache based on the allocated memory. It uses the `OneNodeAvgMemoryEstimate` property from the `PatriciaTree` class to estimate the average memory usage of a single trie node. 

This class is useful for managing the memory usage of the trie node cache in the Nethermind project. By adjusting the `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property, developers can optimize the memory usage of the trie node cache to fit the needs of their specific use case. 

Example usage:

```
// Set the trie node cache memory to 256 megabytes
MemoryAllowance.TrieNodeCacheMemory = 256.MB();

// Get the number of trie nodes that can be stored in the cache
int trieNodeCount = MemoryAllowance.TrieNodeCacheCount;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemoryAllowance` class?
    - The `MemoryAllowance` class is used to manage memory allocation for the `Trie` module.
2. What is the default value for `TrieNodeCacheMemory`?
    - The default value for `TrieNodeCacheMemory` is 128 megabytes.
3. How is `TrieNodeCacheCount` calculated?
    - `TrieNodeCacheCount` is calculated by dividing `TrieNodeCacheMemory` by the average memory estimate for a single node in the `PatriciaTree` data structure.
