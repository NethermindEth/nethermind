The `TreeDumper` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to traverse and dump the contents of a Merkle Patricia Trie. The class implements the `ITreeVisitor` interface, which defines the methods that are called when traversing the trie. The `TreeDumper` class uses a `StringBuilder` to build a string representation of the trie as it is traversed.

The `TreeDumper` class provides methods to visit the different types of nodes in the trie, including branches, extensions, leaves, and code. The `VisitTree` method is called when the root node of the trie is visited, and it prints whether the trie is a state tree or a storage tree. The `VisitMissingNode` method is called when a node is missing from the trie, and it prints the hash of the missing node. The `VisitBranch` method is called when a branch node is visited, and it prints the hash of the node. The `VisitExtension` method is called when an extension node is visited, and it prints the key and hash of the node. The `VisitLeaf` method is called when a leaf node is visited, and it prints the key and hash of the node, as well as the account information if the node is not a storage node. Finally, the `VisitCode` method is called when the code hash of an account is visited, and it prints the hash of the code.

The `TreeDumper` class is used to dump the contents of a trie for debugging and analysis purposes. It can be used to verify the contents of a trie, to analyze the structure of a trie, or to debug issues related to trie traversal. The class can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Nethermind project that implement the `ITrie` interface to traverse and dump the contents of a trie. For example, the `TrieDb` class implements the `ITrie` interface and can be used to traverse and dump the contents of a trie stored in a database. 

Example usage:

```
ITrie trie = new TrieDb();
trie.Put("key1", "value1");
trie.Put("key2", "value2");

TreeDumper dumper = new TreeDumper();
trie.Accept(dumper);

Console.WriteLine(dumper.ToString());
```

This will output a string representation of the trie that includes the keys and values that were added to the trie.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TreeDumper` class?
    
    The `TreeDumper` class is used to visit and dump the contents of a Merkle Patricia Trie data structure.

2. What is the difference between a "STATE TREE" and a "STORAGE TREE"?
    
    A "STATE TREE" represents the current state of the Ethereum blockchain, while a "STORAGE TREE" represents the storage of a smart contract.

3. What is the purpose of the `VisitMissingNode` method?
    
    The `VisitMissingNode` method is called when a node is missing from the trie, and it is used to log the missing node's hash and position in the trie.
