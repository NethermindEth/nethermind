The code above defines a class called `MemoryLimit` that implements the `IPruningStrategy` interface. This class is used to limit the amount of memory used by a trie data structure in the Nethermind project. 

The `MemoryLimit` class takes a `long` value as a parameter in its constructor, which represents the maximum amount of memory that the trie data structure is allowed to use. This value is stored in the `_memoryLimit` field. 

The `PruningEnabled` property always returns `true`, indicating that pruning is enabled for the trie data structure. 

The `ShouldPrune` method takes a `long` value as a parameter, which represents the current amount of memory used by the trie data structure. This method returns `true` if pruning is enabled and the current memory usage is greater than or equal to the `_memoryLimit` value. Otherwise, it returns `false`. 

The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to display the memory limit in megabytes when debugging the code. 

Overall, the `MemoryLimit` class provides a way to limit the amount of memory used by the trie data structure in the Nethermind project. This can be useful in situations where memory usage needs to be controlled or limited, such as in resource-constrained environments. 

Example usage:

```
long memoryLimit = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100 MB
MemoryLimit pruningStrategy = new MemoryLimit(memoryLimit);
bool shouldPrune = pruningStrategy.ShouldPrune(currentMemoryUsage);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemoryLimit` class?
    
    The `MemoryLimit` class is a pruning strategy implementation that checks if the current memory usage exceeds a specified limit and returns a boolean value indicating whether pruning should be performed.

2. What is the significance of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute used in this code?
    
    The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to specify how the object should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it displays the memory limit in megabytes.

3. What is the interface `IPruningStrategy` and how is it related to the `MemoryLimit` class?
    
    `IPruningStrategy` is an interface that defines the contract for pruning strategies. The `MemoryLimit` class implements this interface to provide a specific pruning strategy based on memory usage.
