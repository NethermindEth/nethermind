This code defines an interface called `IReadOnlyTrieStore` within the `Nethermind.Trie.Pruning` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide read-only access to a trie store, which is a data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs. 

The `IReadOnlyTrieStore` interface extends another interface called `ITrieStore`, which likely defines the basic functionality of a trie store, such as inserting and retrieving key-value pairs. By extending `ITrieStore`, `IReadOnlyTrieStore` inherits these basic methods while also adding the constraint that only read operations are allowed. This is useful in situations where a trie store needs to be shared among multiple components of a larger system, but some components should not be able to modify the store. 

For example, imagine a blockchain node that uses a trie store to store account balances. The node's consensus engine needs to be able to modify the trie store as it processes new transactions and updates account balances. However, other components of the node, such as the JSON-RPC API server, should only be able to read the account balances without modifying them. In this case, the node could expose a read-only `IReadOnlyTrieStore` interface to the API server, ensuring that the server cannot accidentally modify the trie store and cause inconsistencies in the blockchain state. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in the larger Nethermind project by providing a standardized interface for read-only access to trie stores. By using this interface throughout the project, developers can ensure that components that only need read access to trie stores cannot accidentally modify them, improving the overall reliability and consistency of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IReadOnlyTrieStore` interface?
   - The `IReadOnlyTrieStore` interface is used for read-only access to a trie store and extends the `ITrieStore` interface.

2. What is the `ITrieStore` interface?
   - The `ITrieStore` interface is a base interface for trie stores and defines methods for getting, putting, and deleting trie nodes.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released and is used to ensure license compliance and facilitate license tracking. In this case, the code is licensed under LGPL-3.0-only.
