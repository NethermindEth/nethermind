This code defines an interface called `IGrpcConfig` that extends the `IConfig` interface from the `Nethermind.Config` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide configuration options for the gRPC protocol in the Nethermind project. 

The `IGrpcConfig` interface has three properties: `Enabled`, `Host`, and `Port`. These properties are decorated with the `ConfigItem` attribute, which provides metadata about the property such as a description and default value. 

The `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether or not the gRPC protocol is enabled. If it is set to `false`, then gRPC will be disabled. The `Host` property is a string that specifies the address of the host under which gRPC will be running. The `Port` property is an integer that specifies the port number under which gRPC will be exposed. 

This interface is decorated with the `ConfigCategory` attribute, which indicates that it is a configuration category. The `DisabledForCli` property is set to `true`, which means that this configuration category is disabled for the command-line interface. The `HiddenFromDocs` property is also set to `true`, which means that this configuration category is hidden from the documentation. 

This interface can be used by other parts of the Nethermind project to configure the behavior of the gRPC protocol. For example, if a developer wants to enable gRPC and expose it on a different port, they can modify the `Enabled` and `Port` properties in an implementation of this interface. 

Here is an example of how this interface might be used in an implementation:

```
public class MyGrpcConfig : IGrpcConfig
{
    public bool Enabled { get; set; } = true;
    public string Host { get; set; } = "localhost";
    public int Port { get; set; } = 50001;
}
```

In this example, an implementation of `IGrpcConfig` is created with the `Enabled` property set to `true`, the `Host` property set to `"localhost"`, and the `Port` property set to `50001`. This implementation can then be used to configure the behavior of the gRPC protocol in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface called `IGrpcConfig` with three properties related to gRPC configuration, using attributes from the `Nethermind.Config` namespace.

2. What is the significance of the `ConfigCategory` attribute?
- The `ConfigCategory` attribute is used to specify additional configuration metadata for the `IGrpcConfig` interface, such as whether it should be hidden from documentation or disabled for command-line interface.

3. What are the default values for the `Enabled`, `Host`, and `Port` properties?
- The `Enabled` property has a default value of `false`, while the `Host` property has a default value of `"localhost"` and the `Port` property has a default value of `50000`.
