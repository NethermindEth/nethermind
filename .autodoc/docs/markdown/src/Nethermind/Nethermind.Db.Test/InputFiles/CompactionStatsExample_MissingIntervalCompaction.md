This code provides statistics on the compaction process of a database. The database is divided into levels, with level 0 being the smallest and fastest, and higher levels being larger and slower. The code provides information on the number of files, size, read and write speeds, and other metrics for each level of the database. 

The purpose of this code is to monitor the performance of the database and identify any issues that may arise during the compaction process. Compaction is the process of merging smaller files into larger ones to improve read and write performance. If the compaction process is not working properly, it can lead to slower read and write speeds and other issues with the database. 

The code provides detailed information on the performance of each level of the database, including the number of files, size, read and write speeds, and other metrics. This information can be used to identify any issues with the compaction process and make adjustments as needed to improve performance. 

For example, if the read and write speeds are slower than expected for a particular level of the database, it may be necessary to adjust the compaction settings to improve performance. Alternatively, if the size of the database is growing too quickly, it may be necessary to adjust the compaction settings to reduce the number of files and improve performance. 

Overall, this code provides valuable information on the performance of the database and can be used to identify and address any issues that may arise during the compaction process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code displays statistics related to compaction, file read latency, and database writes for a project called Nethermind.

2. What do the different levels in the compaction stats represent?
- The different levels in the compaction stats represent the different levels in the LSM tree, with L0 being the bottom level and L1, L2, etc. being higher levels.

3. What is the significance of the file read latency histogram?
- The file read latency histogram shows the distribution of read latencies for different levels in the LSM tree, which can help identify performance issues and bottlenecks in the system.
