This code provides statistics on the compaction process, file read latency, and database writes for the Nethermind project. The purpose of this code is to monitor the performance of the database and identify any potential issues or bottlenecks. 

The first section of the code provides information on the compaction process. It shows the number of files, size, score, and other metrics for each level of the database. The "Moved(GB)" column shows the amount of data that was moved during compaction, while the "W-Amp" column shows the write amplification factor, which is a measure of how much data was written to the database compared to the amount of data that was actually added. The "Comp(sec)" column shows the time it took to perform the compaction, while the "CompMergeCPU(sec)" column shows the CPU time used during the compaction process. 

The second section of the code provides information on file read latency. It shows a histogram of the read latency for each level of the database, along with statistics such as the average, standard deviation, and percentiles. The histogram is divided into ranges of microseconds, and each range shows the number of reads that fell within that range. This information can be used to identify any performance issues related to reading data from the database. 

The third section of the code provides information on database writes. It shows the number of writes, keys, and commit groups, as well as the amount of data ingested and the write rate. It also shows information on the write-ahead log (WAL), including the number of writes and syncs, the number of writes per sync, and the amount of data written. Finally, it shows information on any stalls that occurred during the write process. 

Overall, this code provides valuable information on the performance of the Nethermind database. By monitoring these metrics, developers can identify any issues or bottlenecks and optimize the database for better performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code provides statistics on compaction, file read latency, and database writes for the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the different levels in the compaction stats?
- The different levels in the compaction stats represent different priorities for compaction, with "Low" being the lowest priority and "High" being the highest priority.

3. What is the meaning of the different values in the file read latency histogram?
- The file read latency histogram shows the distribution of read latencies for different levels in the database, with the count, average, standard deviation, and percentiles for each level. The histogram can be used to identify performance issues and optimize read operations.
