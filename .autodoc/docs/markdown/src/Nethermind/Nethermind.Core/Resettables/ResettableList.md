The `ResettableList` class is a generic implementation of a list that can be reset to its initial state. It is part of the Nethermind project and is used to manage lists of objects that need to be reset to their initial state after a certain period of time. 

The class implements the `IList<T>` and `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` interfaces, which means that it can be used like any other list in C#. It has all the standard list methods such as `Add`, `Remove`, `Clear`, `Contains`, `CopyTo`, `IndexOf`, `Insert`, `RemoveAt`, and an indexer. 

The `ResettableList` class has two constructor parameters: `startCapacity` and `resetRatio`. `startCapacity` is the initial capacity of the list, and `resetRatio` is the ratio by which the capacity of the list is reduced when it is reset. 

The `Reset` method is the main feature of this class. It resets the list to its initial state by clearing all the elements and reducing the capacity of the list. If the number of elements in the list is less than the current capacity divided by the reset ratio, the capacity of the list is reduced by the reset ratio. If the number of elements in the list is greater than the current capacity, the capacity is increased by the reset ratio until it is greater than or equal to the number of elements in the list. 

This class can be used in the Nethermind project to manage lists of objects that need to be reset to their initial state. For example, it can be used to manage a list of transactions in a blockchain node. The list can be reset periodically to ensure that the node is processing the latest transactions. 

Example usage:

```
ResettableList<int> myList = new ResettableList<int>(10, 2);
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);
myList.Reset();
// myList is now an empty list with a capacity of 10
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ResettableList` class?
    
    The `ResettableList` class is a generic list implementation that allows resetting the list to its initial capacity.

2. What are the default values for `startCapacity` and `resetRatio` parameters?
    
    The default value for `startCapacity` is `Resettable.StartCapacity`, and the default value for `resetRatio` is `Resettable.ResetRatio`.

3. What happens when the `Reset` method is called?
    
    The `Reset` method checks if the current count of items in the list is less than the current capacity divided by the reset ratio. If it is, the capacity is reduced to the maximum of the start capacity and the current capacity divided by the reset ratio. If not, the capacity is increased by multiplying the current capacity by the reset ratio. Finally, the list is cleared.
