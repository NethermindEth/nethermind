The `ChainLevelInfo` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to store information about a chain level. It contains information about whether a block is on the main chain, the block information, and methods to find block information and main chain blocks.

The `ChainLevelInfo` class has a constructor that takes a boolean value indicating whether a block is on the main chain and an array of `BlockInfo` objects. The `BlockInfo` class contains information about a block, such as its hash, metadata, and number.

The `ChainLevelInfo` class has three properties: `HasNonBeaconBlocks`, `HasBeaconBlocks`, and `BlockInfos`. The `HasNonBeaconBlocks` property returns true if there are any blocks in the `BlockInfos` array that are not beacon blocks. The `HasBeaconBlocks` property returns true if there are any beacon blocks in the `BlockInfos` array. The `BlockInfos` property returns an array of `BlockInfo` objects.

The `ChainLevelInfo` class also has two methods: `MainChainBlock` and `BeaconMainChainBlock`. The `MainChainBlock` method returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array if `HasBlockOnMainChain` is true, otherwise it returns null. The `BeaconMainChainBlock` method returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array that has the `BeaconMainChain` metadata flag set, otherwise it returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array.

Finally, the `ChainLevelInfo` class has a `FindBlockInfoIndex` method that takes a `Keccak` block hash and returns the index of the `BlockInfo` object in the `BlockInfos` array that has the same hash, or null if no such object exists.

Overall, the `ChainLevelInfo` class is used to store information about a chain level, such as whether a block is on the main chain and the block information. It provides methods to find block information and main chain blocks. This class is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project that deal with blockchains and chain levels.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainLevelInfo` class?
- The `ChainLevelInfo` class is used to store information about a level in the blockchain, including whether it has blocks on the main chain, an array of `BlockInfo` objects, and methods to find specific blocks within the level.

2. What is the purpose of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute on the `ChainLevelInfo` class?
- The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to specify how the `ChainLevelInfo` object should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it will show whether the level has a block on the main chain and how many blocks are in the level.

3. What is the purpose of the `BeaconMainChainBlock` property?
- The `BeaconMainChainBlock` property is used to find the first block in the level that has the `BeaconMainChain` metadata flag set. If no blocks have this flag set, it will return the first block in the level.
