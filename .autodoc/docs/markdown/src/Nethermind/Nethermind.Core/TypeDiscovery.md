The `TypeDiscovery` class provides functionality for discovering types within the Nethermind project. The class contains two public methods: `FindNethermindTypes(Type baseType)` and `FindNethermindTypes(string typeName)`. Both methods return an `IEnumerable<Type>` of all types that match the specified criteria.

The `LoadAll()` method is a private method that is called by both public methods. It loads all assemblies that are not part of the .NET framework and are not already loaded. It then filters out any assemblies that are not part of the Nethermind project. The filtered assemblies are stored in a private static `HashSet<Assembly>` field called `_nethermindAssemblies`. The method uses a lock to ensure that it is only called once.

The `FindNethermindTypes(Type baseType)` method returns all types that are assignable from the specified `baseType`. It first calls `LoadAll()` to ensure that all Nethermind assemblies are loaded. It then uses LINQ to select all types that are assignable from the specified `baseType` and are not the same as the `baseType`.

The `FindNethermindTypes(string typeName)` method returns all types that have the specified `typeName`. It first calls `LoadAll()` to ensure that all Nethermind assemblies are loaded. It then uses LINQ to select all types that have the specified `typeName`.

Overall, the `TypeDiscovery` class provides a convenient way to discover types within the Nethermind project. It is useful for dynamically loading types at runtime and for discovering types that are not known at compile time. For example, it could be used to discover all implementations of a particular interface or all types that have a particular attribute.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TypeDiscovery` class?
    
    The `TypeDiscovery` class is used to discover and load all types that belong to the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `_nethermindAssemblies` field?
    
    The `_nethermindAssemblies` field is a `HashSet` that contains all the assemblies that belong to the Nethermind project.

3. What is the purpose of the `LoadAll` method?
    
    The `LoadAll` method is used to load all assemblies that belong to the Nethermind project and their dependencies. It is called by the `FindNethermindTypes` methods to ensure that all types are loaded before searching for them.
