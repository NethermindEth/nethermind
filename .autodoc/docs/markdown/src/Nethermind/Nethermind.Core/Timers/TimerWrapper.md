The `TimerWrapper` class is a wrapper around the `System.Timers.Timer` class that implements the `ITimer` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a more convenient and testable interface for working with timers in the Nethermind project. 

The `TimerWrapper` constructor takes a `System.Timers.Timer` instance as a parameter and sets up an event handler for the `Elapsed` event. The `Elapsed` event is raised when the timer interval has elapsed. The `TimerWrapper` class exposes properties and methods that allow the timer to be configured and controlled. 

The `AutoReset` property gets or sets a value indicating whether the timer should raise the `Elapsed` event each time the interval elapses, or only once. The `Enabled` property gets or sets a value indicating whether the timer is running. The `Interval` property gets or sets the interval at which to raise the `Elapsed` event. The `IntervalMilliseconds` property gets or sets the interval in milliseconds. The `Start` method starts the timer, and the `Stop` method stops the timer. 

The `Elapsed` event is raised when the timer interval has elapsed. This event is exposed by the `ITimer` interface and can be subscribed to by clients of the `TimerWrapper` class. 

The `Dispose` method disposes of the `TimerWrapper` instance and removes the event handler for the `Elapsed` event. 

Overall, the `TimerWrapper` class provides a simple and convenient interface for working with timers in the Nethermind project. It allows for easy configuration and control of timers, and provides a testable interface for working with timers in unit tests. 

Example usage:

```
var timer = new TimerWrapper(new System.Timers.Timer());
timer.Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
timer.AutoReset = true;
timer.Elapsed += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine("Timer elapsed!");
timer.Start();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `TimerWrapper` class that implements the `ITimer` interface and wraps a `System.Timers.Timer` instance.

2. What methods and properties are available in the `ITimer` interface?
- The `ITimer` interface includes methods `Start()` and `Stop()`, properties `AutoReset`, `Enabled`, `Interval`, and `IntervalMilliseconds`, and an event `Elapsed`.

3. What is the significance of the `Elapsed` event in this code?
- The `Elapsed` event is raised when the timer interval has elapsed, and it is invoked in the `OnElapsed` method of the `TimerWrapper` class.
