The code provided is a C# file that contains an extension method for the `ISpecProvider` interface. The `ISpecProvider` interface is part of the Nethermind.Core.Specs namespace and is used to provide specifications for Ethereum blocks. The purpose of this code is to provide two extension methods that allow the caller to retrieve a specific type of specification from an `ISpecProvider` instance.

The first method, `GetReceiptSpec`, returns an `IReceiptSpec` instance for a given block number. The `IReceiptSpec` interface is used to provide specifications for Ethereum transaction receipts. The method is added to the `ISpecProvider` interface as an extension method, which means that it can be called on any instance of `ISpecProvider`. The method takes two parameters: an `ISpecProvider` instance and a `long` block number. The method returns an `IReceiptSpec` instance.

The second method, `GetSpecFor1559`, returns an `IEip1559Spec` instance for a given block number. The `IEip1559Spec` interface is used to provide specifications for Ethereum blocks that use the EIP-1559 transaction fee market. The method is also added to the `ISpecProvider` interface as an extension method. The method takes two parameters: an `ISpecProvider` instance and a `long` block number. The method returns an `IEip1559Spec` instance.

Both methods are added to the `ISpecProvider` interface as extension methods because they are not part of the core functionality of the interface. Instead, they provide convenience methods for retrieving specific types of specifications. These methods can be used by other parts of the Nethermind project that need to retrieve specifications for Ethereum blocks, transactions, or receipts. For example, a module that processes Ethereum transactions might use the `GetReceiptSpec` method to retrieve the receipt specification for a given block number. Similarly, a module that processes blocks that use the EIP-1559 transaction fee market might use the `GetSpecFor1559` method to retrieve the EIP-1559 specification for a given block number.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SpecProviderExtensions` class?
   - The `SpecProviderExtensions` class provides extension methods for the `ISpecProvider` interface.
2. What is the difference between the `GetReceiptSpec` and `GetSpecFor1559` methods?
   - The `GetReceiptSpec` method returns an `IReceiptSpec` related to receipts, while the `GetSpecFor1559` method returns an `IEip1559Spec` related to EIP-1559.
3. Why are these methods added to the `SpecProviderExtensions` class?
   - These methods are added to the `SpecProviderExtensions` class to provide convenient access to spec-related information when the timestamp is unknown.
