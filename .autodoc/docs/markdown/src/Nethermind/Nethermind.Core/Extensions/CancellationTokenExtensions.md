The code in this file defines two extension methods for the CancellationToken class, which is part of the System.Threading namespace in C#. These methods provide additional functionality to the CancellationToken class, which is used to signal cancellation of an operation.

The first method, AsTask, converts a CancellationToken to a Task that can be awaited. When the CancellationToken is cancelled, the returned Task will complete. This method is useful when you want to wait for a CancellationToken to be cancelled before continuing with other operations. Here is an example of how to use this method:

```
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
CancellationToken token = cts.Token;

Task task = token.AsTask();
cts.Cancel();

await task;
```

In this example, a CancellationTokenSource is created and its token is passed to the AsTask method. The method returns a Task that is awaited, which will complete when the CancellationToken is cancelled. The CancellationTokenSource is then cancelled, which causes the Task to complete.

The second method, CancelDisposeAndClear, cancels and disposes a CancellationTokenSource and sets it to null. This method is thread-safe and uses the Interlocked.CompareExchange method to safely manage the reference to the CancellationTokenSource. This method is useful when you want to cancel a CancellationTokenSource and ensure that it is disposed of properly. Here is an example of how to use this method:

```
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

// Do some work...

cts.CancelDisposeAndClear(ref cts);
```

In this example, a CancellationTokenSource is created and some work is done. The CancellationTokenSource is then cancelled, disposed, and set to null using the CancelDisposeAndClear method.

Overall, these extension methods provide useful functionality for working with CancellationToken objects in C#. The AsTask method allows you to wait for a CancellationToken to be cancelled, while the CancelDisposeAndClear method ensures that a CancellationTokenSource is properly cancelled and disposed. These methods can be used in a variety of scenarios where cancellation is needed, such as in long-running operations or in multi-threaded applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AsTask` method?
    
    The `AsTask` method converts a `CancellationToken` to an awaitable `Task` when the token is cancelled.

2. What does the `CancelDisposeAndClear` method do?
    
    The `CancelDisposeAndClear` method cancels and disposes of a `CancellationTokenSource` and sets it to null so that multiple calls to this method are safe and `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()` will be called only once.

3. What is the purpose of the `Interlocked.CompareExchange` method in the `CancelDisposeAndClear` method?
    
    The `Interlocked.CompareExchange` method is used to safely manage the reference to the `CancellationTokenSource` in a thread-safe manner. It ensures that only one thread can access the reference at a time.
