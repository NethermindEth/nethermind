The `SizeExtensions` class in the `Nethermind` project provides extension methods to convert between different units of digital storage size. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to convert between different units of storage size, such as gigabytes, megabytes, and kilobytes, without having to manually calculate the conversions.

The class contains extension methods for both `long` and `int` data types, which return the converted size in bytes. The methods are named after the unit of storage size they convert to, such as `GB()`, `MB()`, and `KB()`. For example, calling the `GB()` method on a `long` or `int` value will return the value converted to gigabytes.

The conversion factors used in the methods are hard-coded into the methods themselves, and are based on the standard definitions of the different units of storage size. For example, 1 gigabyte is defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes, and 1 megabyte is defined as 1,000,000 bytes. The conversion factors are used to multiply the input value to convert it to the desired unit of storage size.

The `SizeExtensions` class is likely used throughout the `Nethermind` project to convert between different units of storage size as needed. For example, it may be used in code that deals with file I/O, network data transfer, or database storage. By providing a set of standardized conversion methods, the `SizeExtensions` class helps to ensure consistency and accuracy in storage size calculations throughout the project.

Example usage:

```
long fileSize = 1024L * 1024L * 1024L; // 1 gigabyte
long fileSizeInMegabytes = fileSize.MB(); // 1,024 megabytes
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines extension methods for converting between different units of size (KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB) represented as integers or longs.

2. What is the significance of the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet what the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace is used for. It is possible that it contains additional functionality related to 256-bit integers.

3. Why are the extension methods defined for both `int` and `long` types?
   - The extension methods are defined for both `int` and `long` types to provide flexibility for developers who may be working with either data type.
