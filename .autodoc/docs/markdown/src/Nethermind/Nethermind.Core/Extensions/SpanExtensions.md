The `SpanExtensions` class provides extension methods for `Span<byte>` and `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` types. These methods allow for converting byte arrays to hexadecimal strings, checking if a span is null or empty, and checking if a span is null.

The `ToHexString` methods convert a span of bytes to a hexadecimal string. There are several overloads of this method that allow for different formatting options. The `withZeroX` parameter specifies whether the resulting string should have a "0x" prefix. The `noLeadingZeros` parameter specifies whether leading zeros should be omitted from the resulting string. The `withEip55Checksum` parameter specifies whether the resulting string should include an EIP-55 checksum. The EIP-55 checksum is a case-sensitive checksum used in Ethereum addresses to prevent errors caused by mistyping addresses.

The `IsNull` and `IsNullOrEmpty` methods check if a span is null or empty. These methods are useful for checking if a span is valid before performing operations on it.

Overall, the `SpanExtensions` class provides useful utility methods for working with byte arrays in the Nethermind project. Here is an example of how to use the `ToHexString` method:

```
byte[] bytes = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
string hexString = bytes.AsSpan().ToHexString(true);
Console.WriteLine(hexString); // "0x010203"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ToHexString` method and how is it used?
Answer: The `ToHexString` method is used to convert a span of bytes to a hexadecimal string representation. It has several overloads with different parameters to customize the output format.

2. What is the purpose of the `ToHexStringWithEip55Checksum` method and how is it different from `ToHexString`?
Answer: The `ToHexStringWithEip55Checksum` method is used to generate a hexadecimal string representation of a span of bytes with an EIP-55 checksum. This is different from `ToHexString` because it includes a checksum that can be used to validate the address.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsNull` and `IsNullOrEmpty` extension methods for spans?
Answer: The `IsNull` method is used to check if a span is null or not, while the `IsNullOrEmpty` method is used to check if a span is null or empty. These methods can be used to avoid null reference exceptions and simplify code that works with spans.
