The `ExpressionExtensions` class is a utility class that provides extension methods for working with lambda expressions in C#. The class is part of the Nethermind project and is used to simplify the process of working with lambda expressions in the project.

The `GetName` method is used to get the name of a member from a lambda expression. It takes a lambda expression as an argument and returns the name of the member as a string. For example, if we have a lambda expression that represents a property called `MyProperty` on a class called `MyClass`, we can use the `GetName` method to get the name of the property like this:

```
Expression<Func<MyClass, int>> expression = x => x.MyProperty;
string propertyName = expression.GetName(); // "MyProperty"
```

The `GetMemberInfo` method is used to get a `MemberExpression` object from a lambda expression. It takes a lambda expression as an argument and returns a `MemberExpression` object that represents the member that the lambda expression refers to. This method is used internally by the `GetName` and `GetSetter` methods.

The `GetSetter` method is used to convert a lambda expression for a getter into a setter. It takes a lambda expression that represents a property getter as an argument and returns an `Action` delegate that can be used to set the value of the property. For example, if we have a lambda expression that represents a property called `MyProperty` on a class called `MyClass`, we can use the `GetSetter` method to get an `Action` delegate that can be used to set the value of the property like this:

```
Expression<Func<MyClass, int>> expression = x => x.MyProperty;
Action<MyClass, int> setter = expression.GetSetter();
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
setter(obj, 42); // sets obj.MyProperty to 42
```

Overall, the `ExpressionExtensions` class provides a set of utility methods that simplify the process of working with lambda expressions in the Nethermind project. The `GetName` method is used to get the name of a member from a lambda expression, the `GetMemberInfo` method is used to get a `MemberExpression` object from a lambda expression, and the `GetSetter` method is used to convert a lambda expression for a getter into a setter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExpressionExtensions` class?
- The `ExpressionExtensions` class provides extension methods for working with expressions in C#.

2. What does the `GetName` method do?
- The `GetName` method takes an expression that represents a member access and returns the name of the member.

3. What does the `GetSetter` method do?
- The `GetSetter` method takes an expression that represents a property getter and returns a compiled lambda expression that can be used to set the value of the property.
