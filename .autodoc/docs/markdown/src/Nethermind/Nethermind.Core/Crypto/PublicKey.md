The `PublicKey` class in the `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespace is responsible for representing a public key in Ethereum. It provides methods to compute the address of the public key and to compare two public keys for equality. 

The `PublicKey` class has two constants, `PrefixedLengthInBytes` and `LengthInBytes`, which represent the length of a public key with and without a prefix, respectively. The class has two constructors, one that takes a hex string and another that takes a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` representing the bytes of the public key. The constructor that takes a hex string converts the string to bytes using the `FromHexString` method of the `Bytes` class in the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace. The constructor that takes a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` checks the length of the bytes and throws an exception if it is not equal to `LengthInBytes` or `PrefixedLengthInBytes`. If the length is `PrefixedLengthInBytes`, it also checks that the first byte is `0x04`, which is the prefix for an uncompressed public key. It then extracts the last 64 bytes of the input bytes, which represent the public key without the prefix, and stores them in the `Bytes` property.

The `PublicKey` class has a `Address` property that returns the address of the public key. The address is computed lazily the first time the property is accessed and then cached. The `ComputeAddress` method is responsible for computing the address of the public key. It uses the `ValueKeccak.Compute` method to compute the Keccak-256 hash of the public key bytes and then takes the last 20 bytes of the hash to create an `Address` object.

The `PublicKey` class also has a `PrefixedBytes` property that returns the public key bytes with the prefix `0x04`. The property is computed lazily the first time the property is accessed and then cached. The `ToString` method returns the hex string representation of the public key bytes. It has an overload that takes a boolean parameter `with0X` that determines whether the `0x` prefix should be included in the output. The `ToShortString` method returns a shortened version of the hex string representation of the public key bytes, with the first and last 6 characters separated by `...`.

The `PublicKey` class implements the `IEquatable<PublicKey>` interface and provides overloaded `==` and `!=` operators for comparing two public keys for equality. The `Equals` method compares the bytes of the two public keys using the `Bytes.AreEqual` method in the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace. The `GetHashCode` method returns the hash code of the first 4 bytes of the public key bytes.

Overall, the `PublicKey` class provides a convenient way to represent and manipulate public keys in Ethereum. It is used in various parts of the Nethermind project, such as in the `Account` class to represent the public key of an account.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PublicKey` class in the `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespace?
- The `PublicKey` class represents a public key in cryptography and provides methods for computing its address and comparing it to other public keys.

2. What is the difference between `PrefixedLengthInBytes` and `LengthInBytes`?
- `PrefixedLengthInBytes` is the length of a public key with a prefix byte, while `LengthInBytes` is the length of a public key without a prefix byte.

3. What is the purpose of the `ComputeAddress` method?
- The `ComputeAddress` method computes the address of the public key using the Keccak hash function and returns it as an `Address` object.
