The `LinkedHashSet` class is a custom implementation of a hash set that maintains the order of elements as they are added to the set. It is a generic class that can be used with any type that is not null. The class implements the `ISet<T>` and `IReadOnlySet<T>` interfaces, which provide a set of methods for working with sets of elements.

The `LinkedHashSet` class uses a dictionary and a linked list to store the elements. The dictionary provides fast access to elements by their key, while the linked list maintains the order of the elements. When an element is added to the set, it is added to the end of the linked list and a reference to the node is added to the dictionary. When an element is removed from the set, its reference is removed from the dictionary and the node is removed from the linked list.

The `LinkedHashSet` class provides several constructors that allow the user to create a set with an initial capacity or to initialize the set with a collection of elements. The class also provides methods for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements in the set. In addition, the class provides methods for performing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

One of the main benefits of using the `LinkedHashSet` class is that it maintains the order of the elements as they are added to the set. This can be useful in situations where the order of the elements is important, such as when processing data in a specific order. The `LinkedHashSet` class can also be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `HashSet` class, with the added benefit of maintaining the order of the elements.

Example usage:

```csharp
// Create a new LinkedHashSet
LinkedHashSet<int> set = new LinkedHashSet<int>();

// Add some elements to the set
set.Add(1);
set.Add(2);
set.Add(3);

// Remove an element from the set
set.Remove(2);

// Check if an element is in the set
bool contains = set.Contains(1);

// Perform a set operation
LinkedHashSet<int> otherSet = new LinkedHashSet<int> { 2, 3, 4 };
set.IntersectWith(otherSet);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the Nethermind project?
- This code defines a `LinkedHashSet` class that implements the `ISet` and `IReadOnlySet` interfaces. It is used in the Nethermind project to provide a set data structure that maintains the order of elements as they are added.

2. What is the difference between `IsProperSubsetOf` and `IsSubsetOf` methods?
- `IsSubsetOf` returns true if all elements in the current set are also in the specified set, while `IsProperSubsetOf` returns true if all elements in the current set are also in the specified set and the specified set contains at least one element that is not in the current set.

3. Why does the `SymmetricExceptWith` method remove elements from both the current set and the specified set?
- The `SymmetricExceptWith` method removes elements that are in either the current set or the specified set, but not in both. To achieve this, it needs to remove elements that are in the current set but not in the specified set, as well as elements that are in the specified set but not in the current set.
