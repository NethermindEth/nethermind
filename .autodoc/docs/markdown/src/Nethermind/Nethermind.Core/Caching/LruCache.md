The `LruCache` class is a generic implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It is used to store key-value pairs in memory, with a maximum capacity specified at initialization. When the cache reaches its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is removed to make space for a new item. 

The class implements the `ICache` interface, which defines methods for getting, setting, and deleting items from the cache. The `Get` method retrieves the value associated with a given key, and moves the corresponding item to the front of the cache to mark it as the most recently used. The `TryGet` method is similar to `Get`, but returns a boolean indicating whether the key was found in the cache. The `Set` method adds a new key-value pair to the cache, or updates the value associated with an existing key. If the cache is at maximum capacity, the least recently used item is removed to make space for the new item. The `Delete` method removes a key-value pair from the cache. The `Contains` method returns a boolean indicating whether a given key is present in the cache. The `ToArray` method returns an array of all key-value pairs in the cache.

The `LruCache` class uses a `Dictionary` to store key-value pairs, and a `LinkedList` to keep track of the order in which items were last accessed. Each node in the linked list contains a `LruCacheItem` struct, which holds a key-value pair. The `LinkedListNode` class provides methods for moving nodes to the front of the list, or removing them from the list.

The `LruCache` class is thread-safe, with all methods marked with the `MethodImplOptions.Synchronized` attribute to ensure that only one thread can access the cache at a time.

The `LruCache` class also includes a `MemorySize` property and a `CalculateMemorySize` method, which can be used to estimate the memory usage of the cache. The `MemorySizes` class provides constants for the sizes of various data types, and the `FindNextPrime` method is used to calculate the size of the internal dictionary used by the cache.

Overall, the `LruCache` class provides a simple and efficient way to implement an LRU cache in C#. It can be used in a variety of contexts where fast access to frequently used data is important, such as database queries or web page caching.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `LruCache` that implements the `ICache` interface and provides a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism for key-value pairs.

2. What are the input requirements for this code?
   - The `LruCache` class requires two type parameters `TKey` and `TValue`, where `TKey` must be a non-null type. It also requires an integer `maxCapacity` to specify the maximum number of items that can be stored in the cache, and an optional integer `startCapacity` to specify the initial capacity of the internal dictionary used for storing the cache items.

3. What is the performance impact of using this code?
   - The `LruCache` class is thread-safe and provides constant-time complexity for all its operations, including `Get`, `TryGet`, `Set`, `Delete`, and `Contains`. However, the memory usage of the cache may grow beyond the specified `maxCapacity` if the initial capacity is set too high, which may affect the performance of the application.
