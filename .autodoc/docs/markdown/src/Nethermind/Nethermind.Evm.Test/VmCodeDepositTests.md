This code file contains two test methods that test the behavior of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in certain scenarios. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the EVM behaves as expected in these scenarios and to catch any bugs or issues that may arise.

The first test method, `Regression_mainnet_6108276()`, tests the behavior of the EVM when a contract call fails due to a lack of gas for code deposit payment. The test creates a new contract and attempts to call it with insufficient gas to cover the cost of depositing the contract's code. The test then checks that the call failed and that no refunds were given. This test is important because it ensures that the EVM correctly handles situations where a contract call fails due to insufficient gas.

The second test method, `Regression_mainnet_226522()`, tests the behavior of the EVM when a contract call fails due to an out-of-gas error before the EIP-2 upgrade. The test creates a new contract and attempts to call it with insufficient gas to cover the cost of depositing the contract's code. The test then checks that the call failed and that a refund was given. This test is important because it ensures that the EVM correctly handles situations where a contract call fails due to an out-of-gas error.

Both test methods use the `VirtualMachineTestsBase` class as a base class, which provides a set of helper methods for executing EVM code and checking the results. The tests also use various classes and methods from the `Nethermind` project, such as `Address`, `StorageCell`, `Prepare.EvmCode`, and `TestState`. These classes and methods are used to create and manipulate accounts, storage, and EVM code.

Overall, this code file is an important part of the Nethermind project's test suite, as it ensures that the EVM behaves correctly in certain scenarios. The tests in this file can be run as part of the larger test suite to ensure that the EVM is functioning correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VmCodeDepositTests` class?
- The `VmCodeDepositTests` class is a test suite for testing the behavior of code deposit payment and refunds in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

2. What is the significance of the `Regression_mainnet_6108276` test?
- The `Regression_mainnet_6108276` test checks that refunds are not given when a call fails due to lack of gas for code deposit payment.

3. What is the purpose of the `Regression_mainnet_226522` test?
- The `Regression_mainnet_226522` test checks the behavior of code deposit payment and refunds before the EIP-2 upgrade.
