The `StackTraceUsageUtils` class provides utilities for dealing with `StackTraceUsage` values in the NLog logging library. This class is used to skip one more class in the stack trace when logging messages. 

The `LookupAssemblyFromStackFrame` method returns the assembly from the provided `StackFrame` if it is not an internal assembly. If the assembly is internal, it returns null. The `LookupClassNameFromStackFrame` method returns the class name from the provided `StackFrame` if it is not from an internal assembly. If the assembly is internal, it returns an empty string. 

The `GetStackFrameMethodClassName` method returns the fully qualified name of the class that invoked the calling method, including the namespace but not the assembly. It takes four parameters: `method`, `includeNameSpace`, `cleanAsyncMoveNext`, and `cleanAnonymousDelegates`. If `method` is null, it returns null. If `cleanAsyncMoveNext` is true and `method` is a MoveNext method, it returns the declaring type of the method. If `cleanAnonymousDelegates` is true and the class name contains `+<>`, it removes the `+<>` and everything after it. 

The `GetClassFullName` method returns the fully qualified name of the class that invoked the calling method, including the namespace but not the assembly. It takes a `StackFrame` parameter and returns the fully qualified class name. If the class name is null or empty, it returns the fully qualified class name from the `StackTrace`. 

Overall, this class is used to get the fully qualified name of the class that invoked the calling method, including the namespace but not the assembly, and to skip one more class in the stack trace when logging messages. It is used internally by the NLog logging library and is not intended to be used directly by developers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utilities for dealing with `StackTraceUsage` values and getting the fully qualified name of the class invoking the calling method, including the namespace but not the assembly.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has a dependency on the `NLog` assembly, version 4.0.0.0, as well as the `mscorlib` and `System` assemblies.

3. What is the significance of the `MethodImplOptions.NoInlining` attribute on the `GetClassFullName` method?
- The `MethodImplOptions.NoInlining` attribute on the `GetClassFullName` method ensures that the method is not inlined by the JIT compiler, which would affect the accuracy of the stack trace.
