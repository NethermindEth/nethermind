The `PendingSyncItemsTests` class is a test suite for the `PendingSyncItems` class, which is responsible for managing the synchronization of state, storage, and code data between nodes in the Nethermind project. The `PendingSyncItems` class is not included in this file, but it is likely that it is used in the larger project to manage the synchronization of data between nodes.

The `PendingSyncItemsTests` class contains a series of tests that verify the behavior of the `PendingSyncItems` class. The tests cover a range of scenarios, including verifying that the count is zero at the start, that the description does not throw an exception at the start, and that the `PeekState` method returns null at the start. The tests also cover more complex scenarios, such as verifying that the `Prioritizes_depth` test prioritizes items based on their depth, and that the `Prefers_left` test prefers the left branch when there is a choice.

The `PushCode`, `PushStorage`, and `PushState` methods are helper methods that create `StateSyncItem` objects with the specified `NodeDataType`, `level`, `rightness`, and `progress` values, and push them onto the `PendingSyncItems` object using the `PushToSelectedStream` method. These methods are used in the tests to create test data.

Overall, the `PendingSyncItemsTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project, as it ensures that the `PendingSyncItems` class is working as expected and that data is being synchronized correctly between nodes. The tests provide a high level of confidence that the synchronization process is working correctly, which is critical for the overall success of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PendingSyncItems` class?
- The `PendingSyncItems` class is used for managing and prioritizing pending synchronization items during fast sync in the Nethermind project.

2. What are the different types of `NodeDataType` that can be pushed to the `PendingSyncItems`?
- The different types of `NodeDataType` that can be pushed to the `PendingSyncItems` are `State`, `Storage`, and `Code`.

3. What is the significance of the `Rightness` property in the `StateSyncItem` class?
- The `Rightness` property in the `StateSyncItem` class is used to determine the order in which items are processed during synchronization, with items that are further to the left being prioritized over those that are further to the right.
