The `SyncPeerMock` class is a mock implementation of the `ISyncPeer` interface, which is used to synchronize blocks and transactions between nodes in the Nethermind blockchain. This class is used for testing purposes to simulate a peer node that can send and receive data from another node.

The `SyncPeerMock` constructor takes in an `IBlockTree` object, which represents the blockchain tree of the remote node that this mock peer is syncing with. It also takes in optional parameters for the public keys and client IDs of both the local and remote nodes. These parameters are used to create `Node` objects that represent the local and remote nodes.

The `SyncPeerMock` class implements the `ISyncPeer` interface, which defines methods for syncing blocks and transactions between nodes. The `GetBlockBodies`, `GetBlockHeaders`, and `GetReceipts` methods are used to retrieve block data from the remote node. The `NotifyOfNewBlock` and `SendNewTransactions` methods are used to send block and transaction data to the remote node.

The `SyncPeerMock` class uses a `BlockingCollection<Action>` object to queue up actions that need to be executed on the remote node. The `RunQueue` method runs in a separate thread and dequeues actions from the queue, executing them one by one. The `SendNewBlock` and `HintNewBlock` methods add actions to the queue to send block data to the remote node.

Overall, the `SyncPeerMock` class is a useful tool for testing the synchronization functionality of the Nethermind blockchain. It allows developers to simulate peer nodes and test the syncing of blocks and transactions between them.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncPeerMock` class?
- The `SyncPeerMock` class is used to simulate a synchronization peer for testing purposes.

2. What is the `_sendQueue` field used for?
- The `_sendQueue` field is a `BlockingCollection` used to queue up actions to be executed by the `RunQueue` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `RegisterSatelliteProtocol` and `TryGetSatelliteProtocol` methods?
- These methods are placeholders that are not yet implemented and are intended to allow for registering and retrieving satellite protocols for the synchronization peer.
