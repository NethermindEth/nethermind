The `ProgressTrackerTests` class is a test suite for the `ProgressTracker` class in the Nethermind project. The `ProgressTracker` class is responsible for tracking the progress of the SnapSync process, which is a synchronization mechanism that allows nodes to quickly synchronize their state with other nodes in the network. The `ProgressTrackerTests` class contains two test methods that test the functionality of the `ProgressTracker` class.

The first test method, `Did_not_have_race_issue()`, tests whether the `ProgressTracker` class has any race conditions. The test creates a `BlockTree` object and a `ProgressTracker` object, and then enqueues a `StorageRange` object to the `ProgressTracker` object. The test then creates two tasks: one that repeatedly calls the `GetNextRequest()` method of the `ProgressTracker` object, and one that repeatedly calls the `IsSnapGetRangesFinished()` method of the `ProgressTracker` object. The test ensures that the `GetNextRequest()` method returns a `SnapSyncBatch` object with a `StorageRangeRequest` property that is not null, and that the `IsSnapGetRangesFinished()` method returns false. The test repeats this process 100,000 times to ensure that there are no race conditions in the `ProgressTracker` class.

The second test method, `Will_create_multiple_get_address_range_request()`, tests whether the `ProgressTracker` class correctly creates multiple `AccountRangeRequest` objects. The test creates a `BlockTree` object and a `ProgressTracker` object with a batch size of 4. The test then calls the `GetNextRequest()` method of the `ProgressTracker` object 4 times, and ensures that each `SnapSyncBatch` object returned has an `AccountRangeRequest` property that is not null, and that the `StartingHash` and `LimitHash` properties of each `AccountRangeRequest` object are correct. The test then calls the `GetNextRequest()` method of the `ProgressTracker` object one more time, and ensures that the returned `SnapSyncBatch` object is null.

Overall, the `ProgressTrackerTests` class tests the functionality of the `ProgressTracker` class in the Nethermind project, which is responsible for tracking the progress of the SnapSync process. The tests ensure that the `ProgressTracker` class does not have any race conditions, and that it correctly creates multiple `AccountRangeRequest` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProgressTracker` class?
- The `ProgressTracker` class is used for tracking the progress of snapshot synchronization in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `Repeat(3)` attribute in the `Did_not_have_race_issue()` test method?
- The `Repeat(3)` attribute specifies that the test method should be repeated three times to ensure that there are no race issues in the `ProgressTracker` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `Will_create_multiple_get_address_range_request()` test method?
- The `Will_create_multiple_get_address_range_request()` test method tests whether the `ProgressTracker` class can create multiple `AccountRangeRequest` objects for snapshot synchronization.
