The `SyncDbTunerTests` class is a unit test suite for the `SyncDbTuner` class in the Nethermind project. The `SyncDbTuner` class is responsible for tuning the database used by the synchronization process based on the current synchronization mode. The `SyncDbTunerTests` class tests the behavior of the `SyncDbTuner` class under different synchronization modes.

The `SyncDbTuner` class takes in several parameters, including the synchronization configuration, synchronization feeds, and database instances. The synchronization feeds are used to monitor the state of the synchronization process, while the database instances are used to tune the database based on the current synchronization mode. The `SyncDbTuner` class exposes a `Tune` method that takes in a `TuneType` parameter and tunes the database accordingly.

The `SyncDbTunerTests` class tests the behavior of the `SyncDbTuner` class under different synchronization modes. Each test case sets up the required parameters for the `SyncDbTuner` class and triggers a specific synchronization feed. The test then checks if the corresponding database instance has been tuned with the correct `TuneType`. Finally, the test triggers the synchronization feed again and checks if the database instance has been tuned back to the default `TuneType`.

For example, the `WhenSnapIsOn_TriggerStateDbTune` test case tests the behavior of the `SyncDbTuner` class when the `SnapSync` feed is active. The test sets up the required parameters for the `SyncDbTuner` class and triggers the `SnapSync` feed. The test then checks if the `stateDb` instance has been tuned with the `HeavyWrite` `TuneType`. Finally, the test triggers the `SnapSync` feed again and checks if the `stateDb` instance has been tuned back to the default `TuneType`.

Overall, the `SyncDbTunerTests` class tests the behavior of the `SyncDbTuner` class under different synchronization modes and ensures that the database is tuned correctly based on the current synchronization mode. This helps to optimize the synchronization process and improve its performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncDbTuner` class?
- The `SyncDbTuner` class is responsible for tuning the state, code, block, and receipt databases based on the synchronization configuration.

2. What is the purpose of the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method?
- The `TestFeedAndDbTune` method tests whether the state, code, block, and receipt databases are being tuned correctly based on the synchronization feed state.

3. What is the purpose of the `TuneType` enum?
- The `TuneType` enum is used to specify the type of database tuning to be performed, such as heavy write or default tuning.
