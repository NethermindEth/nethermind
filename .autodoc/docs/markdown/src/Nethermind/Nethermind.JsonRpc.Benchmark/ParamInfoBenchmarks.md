The `ParamInfoBenchmarks` class is used to benchmark the performance of retrieving parameter information for methods in the `EthRpcModule` class. The purpose of this benchmark is to compare the performance of retrieving parameter information directly from the `MethodInfo` object versus retrieving it from a cached dictionary or a concurrent dictionary.

The `Scenarios` field is an array of `MethodInfo` objects representing two methods in the `EthRpcModule` class: `eth_getStorageAt` and `eth_blockNumber`. These methods are used as test cases for the benchmark.

The `Current` method is the baseline benchmark, which retrieves the parameter information directly from the `MethodInfo` object. The `Cached` method retrieves the parameter information from a cached dictionary, which is a dictionary that maps `MethodInfo` objects to their corresponding `ParameterInfo` arrays. If the `MethodInfo` object is not in the cache, the `ParameterInfo` array is retrieved and added to the cache. The `Cached_concurrent` method retrieves the parameter information from a concurrent dictionary, which is a thread-safe version of the cached dictionary.

The purpose of this benchmark is to determine whether caching the parameter information improves performance compared to retrieving it directly from the `MethodInfo` object. The results of this benchmark can be used to optimize the performance of the `EthRpcModule` class by determining the most efficient way to retrieve parameter information for its methods.

Example usage:

```csharp
var benchmark = new ParamInfoBenchmarks();
var currentResult = benchmark.Current();
var cachedResult = benchmark.Cached();
var cachedConcurrentResult = benchmark.Cached_concurrent();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for benchmarking the performance of getting parameter information for two methods in the `EthRpcModule` class.

2. What is the difference between the `Cached` and `Cached_concurrent` methods?
- The `Cached` method uses a regular dictionary to cache the parameter information, and uses a lock to ensure thread safety. The `Cached_concurrent` method uses a `ConcurrentDictionary` instead, which is thread-safe and does not require a lock.

3. Why is the `Scenarios` array initialized with two specific methods from the `EthRpcModule` class?
- The `Scenarios` array is used as a parameter source for the `ParamsSource` attribute on the `MethodInfo` field. This allows the benchmark to run for both methods and compare their performance.
