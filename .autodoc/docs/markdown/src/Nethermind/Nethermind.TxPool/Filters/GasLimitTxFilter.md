The `GasLimitTxFilter` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for filtering incoming transactions based on their gas limit. Transactions that exceed the block gas limit or the configured maximum block gas limit are ignored. 

The class implements the `IIncomingTxFilter` interface, which defines a single method `Accept` that takes a `Transaction` object, a `TxFilteringState` object, and a `TxHandlingOptions` object as input parameters and returns an `AcceptTxResult` object. The `Accept` method first calculates the maximum gas limit that can be accepted based on the current block gas limit and the configured maximum block gas limit. It then checks if the gas limit of the input transaction exceeds this maximum limit. If it does, the method returns an `AcceptTxResult` object with a `GasLimitExceeded` status. Otherwise, it returns an `AcceptTxResult` object with an `Accepted` status.

The `GasLimitTxFilter` class has three private fields: `_chainHeadInfoProvider`, `_logger`, and `_configuredGasLimit`. The `_chainHeadInfoProvider` field is an instance of the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface, which provides information about the current chain head. The `_logger` field is an instance of the `ILogger` interface, which is used for logging purposes. The `_configuredGasLimit` field is a long integer that represents the configured maximum block gas limit.

The `GasLimitTxFilter` class has a single constructor that takes three input parameters: an instance of the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface, an instance of the `ITxPoolConfig` interface, and an instance of the `ILogger` interface. The constructor initializes the three private fields with the input parameters.

The `GasLimitTxFilter` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to filter incoming transactions before they are added to the transaction pool. By filtering out transactions that exceed the block gas limit or the configured maximum block gas limit, the `GasLimitTxFilter` class helps to ensure that the transaction pool only contains valid transactions that can be included in the next block. 

Example usage:

```
GasLimitTxFilter gasLimitTxFilter = new GasLimitTxFilter(chainHeadInfoProvider, txPoolConfig, logger);
AcceptTxResult acceptTxResult = gasLimitTxFilter.Accept(transaction, txFilteringState, txHandlingOptions);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a part of the Nethermind project and is a transaction filter that ignores transactions that exceed the block gas limit or the configured max block gas limit.

2. What is the significance of the `GasLimitTxFilter` class being marked as `internal`?
    
    The `internal` access modifier means that the `GasLimitTxFilter` class can only be accessed within the same assembly, which in this case is the Nethermind project. It cannot be accessed by code outside of the project.

3. What is the purpose of the `AcceptTxResult` enum and how is it used in this code?
    
    The `AcceptTxResult` enum is used to indicate the result of accepting a transaction. In this code, it is used to return either `Accepted` or `GasLimitExceeded` depending on whether the transaction's gas limit exceeds the block gas limit or the configured max block gas limit. If `GasLimitExceeded` is returned, it may also include a message indicating the gas limit and the gas limit of the rejected transaction.
