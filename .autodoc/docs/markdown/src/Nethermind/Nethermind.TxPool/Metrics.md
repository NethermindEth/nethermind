This code defines a static class called `Metrics` that contains a set of properties that are decorated with custom attributes. These properties are used to track various metrics related to the transaction pool in the Nethermind project. 

The `CounterMetric` attribute is used to mark properties that represent a counter of some kind. These counters are incremented or decremented as certain events occur in the transaction pool. For example, the `PendingTransactionsSent` property tracks the number of pending transactions that have been broadcasted to peers. Similarly, the `PendingTransactionsReceived` property tracks the number of pending transactions that have been received from peers. 

The `GaugeMetric` attribute is used to mark properties that represent a gauge of some kind. These gauges are used to track the current value of some metric. For example, the `TransactionCount` property tracks the current number of transactions in the transaction pool. 

Each property is also decorated with a `Description` attribute that provides a human-readable description of what the metric represents. 

These metrics can be used to monitor the health and performance of the transaction pool in the Nethermind project. For example, if the `PendingTransactionsDiscarded` counter is increasing rapidly, it may indicate that there is a problem with the transaction validation logic. Similarly, if the `TransactionCount` gauge is consistently high, it may indicate that the transaction pool is becoming congested and may need to be pruned. 

Here is an example of how these metrics might be used in practice:

```csharp
using Nethermind.TxPool;

// ...

// Increment the PendingTransactionsSent counter when a transaction is broadcasted
Metrics.PendingTransactionsSent++;

// Decrement the PendingTransactionsReceived counter when a transaction is received
Metrics.PendingTransactionsReceived--;

// Get the current value of the TransactionCount gauge
float transactionCount = Metrics.TransactionCount;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a static class called `Metrics` that contains various properties with descriptions and attributes for tracking metrics related to pending transactions in a transaction pool.

2. What are some examples of metrics being tracked in this code?
   - Some examples of metrics being tracked in this code include the number of pending transactions sent and received, the number of transactions ignored due to various reasons such as low fees or insufficient balance, the number of transactions added or evicted from the pool, and various ratios related to the types of transactions in the block.

3. What are the attributes used in this code and what do they do?
   - The attributes used in this code are `CounterMetric` and `GaugeMetric`. `CounterMetric` is used to track the count of a particular metric, while `GaugeMetric` is used to track a ratio or percentage of a particular metric. These attributes are used in conjunction with a monitoring system to track and visualize the metrics. The `Description` attribute is also used to provide a description of each metric being tracked.
