The `PluginLoaderTests` class is a test suite for the `PluginLoader` class in the Nethermind project. The `PluginLoader` class is responsible for loading and ordering plugins for the Nethermind client. The `PluginLoaderTests` class contains four test methods that test the functionality of the `PluginLoader` class.

The `full_lexicographical_order` test method tests the `OrderPlugins` method of the `PluginLoader` class when no plugin order is specified. The `PluginLoader` class loads the plugins in the order specified in the constructor and then orders them in lexicographical order. The test method creates a `PluginLoader` instance with six plugins and then orders them in lexicographical order. The expected order of the plugins is then compared to the actual order of the plugins.

The `full_order` test method tests the `OrderPlugins` method of the `PluginLoader` class when a plugin order is specified. The `PluginLoader` class loads the plugins in the order specified in the constructor and then orders them according to the plugin order specified in the `PluginConfig` object. The test method creates a `PluginLoader` instance with six plugins and then orders them according to a specified plugin order. The expected order of the plugins is then compared to the actual order of the plugins.

The `partial_lexicographical_order` test method tests the `OrderPlugins` method of the `PluginLoader` class when a partial plugin order is specified. The `PluginLoader` class loads the plugins in the order specified in the constructor and then orders them according to the plugin order specified in the `PluginConfig` object. The test method creates a `PluginLoader` instance with six plugins and then orders them according to a partial plugin order. The expected order of the plugins is then compared to the actual order of the plugins.

The `default_config` test method tests the `OrderPlugins` method of the `PluginLoader` class when no plugin order is specified and the default plugins are used. The `PluginLoader` class loads the default plugins in the order specified in the constructor and then orders them in lexicographical order. The test method creates a `PluginLoader` instance with the default plugins and then orders them in lexicographical order. The expected order of the plugins is then compared to the actual order of the plugins.

Overall, the `PluginLoader` class is an important component of the Nethermind client as it loads and orders plugins that are necessary for the client to function properly. The `PluginLoaderTests` class ensures that the `PluginLoader` class is functioning as expected and that the plugins are loaded and ordered correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PluginLoader` class?
- The `PluginLoader` class is responsible for loading and ordering plugins based on a given configuration.

2. What plugins are being loaded and ordered in the `PluginLoaderTests` class?
- The plugins being loaded and ordered are `AuRaPlugin`, `CliquePlugin`, `EthashPlugin`, `NethDevPlugin`, `HivePlugin`, and `TestPlugin`.

3. What is the purpose of the `full_lexicographical_order` test method?
- The `full_lexicographical_order` test method tests whether the plugins are ordered in full lexicographical order, which means they are ordered alphabetically.
