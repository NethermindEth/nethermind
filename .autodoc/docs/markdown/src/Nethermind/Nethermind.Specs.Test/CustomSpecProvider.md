The `CustomSpecProvider` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to provide specifications for a blockchain network. It implements the `ISpecProvider` interface and provides custom specifications for a blockchain network. 

The `CustomSpecProvider` class has several properties and methods that allow it to provide specifications for a blockchain network. The `NetworkId` and `ChainId` properties are used to identify the network and chain for which the specifications are being provided. The `TransitionActivations` property is an array of `ForkActivation` objects that represent the activation blocks for each fork in the network. The `UpdateMergeTransitionInfo` method is used to update the merge transition information for the network. The `MergeBlockNumber` property returns the block number at which the merge occurred. The `TimestampFork` property is used to specify the timestamp fork for the network. The `TerminalTotalDifficulty` property is used to specify the terminal total difficulty for the network. The `GenesisSpec` property returns the specification for the genesis block. The `GetSpec` method is used to get the specification for a specific fork activation. The `DaoBlockNumber` property returns the block number at which the DAO fork occurred.

The `CustomSpecProvider` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide custom specifications for a blockchain network. It allows developers to specify the activation blocks for each fork in the network and provides a way to get the specification for a specific fork activation. This class is useful for testing and development purposes, as it allows developers to create custom specifications for their blockchain networks. 

Example usage:

```
var customSpecProvider = new CustomSpecProvider(
    (ForkActivation.ByBlockNumber(0), new ReleaseSpec()),
    (ForkActivation.ByBlockNumber(100), new ReleaseSpec())
);

var genesisSpec = customSpecProvider.GenesisSpec;
var fork100Spec = customSpecProvider.GetSpec(ForkActivation.ByBlockNumber(100));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a class called `CustomSpecProvider` which implements the `ISpecProvider` interface. It provides a custom implementation of the Ethereum specification for testing purposes.

2. What are the parameters required to instantiate an object of the `CustomSpecProvider` class?
- An object of the `CustomSpecProvider` class can be instantiated with the following parameters: `networkId` (of type `ulong`), `chainId` (of type `ulong`), and `transitions` (an array of tuples containing a `ForkActivation` object and an `IReleaseSpec` object).

3. What is the purpose of the `UpdateMergeTransitionInfo` method?
- The `UpdateMergeTransitionInfo` method updates the merge transition information by setting the `_theMergeBlock` field to the specified block number and the `TerminalTotalDifficulty` property to the specified total difficulty.
