The `OverridableReleaseSpec` class is a testing utility class that allows for the overriding of certain properties of the `IReleaseSpec` interface. The `IReleaseSpec` interface defines the specifications for a particular Ethereum release, such as the maximum extra data size, maximum code size, minimum gas limit, block reward, and various EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that are enabled or disabled. 

The purpose of the `OverridableReleaseSpec` class is to allow for the testing of different Ethereum releases by overriding certain properties of the `IReleaseSpec` interface. This is useful for testing purposes because it allows developers to test the behavior of their code under different Ethereum releases without having to actually deploy the code to the Ethereum network. 

For example, if a developer wants to test their code under the Istanbul release of Ethereum, they can create an instance of the `OverridableReleaseSpec` class and pass in an instance of the `IstanbulReleaseSpec` class (which implements the `IReleaseSpec` interface for the Istanbul release). They can then override certain properties of the `IstanbulReleaseSpec` class (such as the maximum extra data size or the block reward) to test the behavior of their code under different conditions. 

The `OverridableReleaseSpec` class implements all of the properties of the `IReleaseSpec` interface, and simply delegates the implementation of these properties to the underlying `IReleaseSpec` instance that is passed in to its constructor. The `IsEip3607Enabled` property is the only property that is not delegated to the underlying instance, and can be set directly on the `OverridableReleaseSpec` instance. 

Overall, the `OverridableReleaseSpec` class is a useful testing utility that allows developers to test their code under different Ethereum releases without having to actually deploy the code to the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OverridableReleaseSpec` class?
- The `OverridableReleaseSpec` class is used for testing purposes and allows for the overriding of certain properties based on different releases spec.

2. What is the `IReleaseSpec` interface and where is it defined?
- The `IReleaseSpec` interface is used to define the specifications of a particular release. It is defined in the `Nethermind.Core.Specs` namespace.

3. What is the significance of the `IsEip3607Enabled` property and how is it set?
- The `IsEip3607Enabled` property is used to determine if EIP-3607 is enabled. It is set in the constructor of the `OverridableReleaseSpec` class based on the value of the `_spec.IsEip3607Enabled` property.
