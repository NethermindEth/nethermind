The `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class is a subclass of the `LoadGenesisBlock` class and is used in the Nethermind project to initialize the genesis block for the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `LoadGenesisBlock` class is responsible for loading the genesis block for any consensus algorithm, but the `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class adds additional functionality specific to the AuRa consensus algorithm.

The `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class has a constructor that takes an `AuRaNethermindApi` object as a parameter. This object is used to access the chain specification, state provider, and storage provider. The `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class overrides the `Load` method of the `LoadGenesisBlock` class and calls the `CreateSystemAccounts` method before calling the base `Load` method.

The `CreateSystemAccounts` method checks if the chain specification has any allocations with a constructor. If there are allocations with a constructor, it creates a system account with an address of `Address.Zero` and a balance of `UInt256.Zero`. It then commits the changes to the storage provider and state provider.

The purpose of this code is to create the system accounts required for the AuRa consensus algorithm. These system accounts are used to store the rewards for validators and other system-level transactions. The `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class is used during the initialization of the Nethermind node to ensure that the system accounts are created before the node starts running.

Example usage:

```csharp
var api = new AuRaNethermindApi();
var loadGenesisBlock = new LoadGenesisBlockAuRa(api);
loadGenesisBlock.Load();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class and how does it differ from the `LoadGenesisBlock` class it inherits from?
- The `LoadGenesisBlockAuRa` class is a subclass of `LoadGenesisBlock` that is specific to the AuRa consensus algorithm. It overrides the `Load` method to call `CreateSystemAccounts` before calling the base `Load` method.

2. What is the `CreateSystemAccounts` method doing and why is it necessary?
- The `CreateSystemAccounts` method checks if any of the allocations in the chain specification have a constructor, and if so, creates a new account with address `Address.Zero` and balance `UInt256.Zero`. This is necessary to ensure that the system has enough accounts to deploy contracts and perform other operations.

3. What are the `StepDependencyException` exceptions being thrown in the `CreateSystemAccounts` method and why are they being thrown?
- The `StepDependencyException` exceptions are being thrown if the `_api.ChainSpec`, `_api.StateProvider`, or `_api.StorageProvider` properties are null. This is because these dependencies are required for the `CreateSystemAccounts` method to function correctly, and if they are not present, the method cannot continue.
