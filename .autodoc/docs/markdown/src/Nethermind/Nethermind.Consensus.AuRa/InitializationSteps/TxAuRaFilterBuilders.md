The `TxAuRaFilterBuilders` class is part of the Nethermind project and contains methods for creating transaction filters for the AuRa consensus algorithm. The AuRa consensus algorithm is used in Ethereum-based networks to achieve consensus among validators and produce new blocks. 

The `CreateAuRaTxFilterForProducer` method creates a transaction filter for a producer node. It takes in several parameters, including the `blocksConfig`, `api`, `readOnlyTxProcessorSource`, `minGasPricesContractDataStore`, and `specProvider`. It first creates a base AuRa transaction filter using the `CreateBaseAuRaTxFilter` method, which takes in similar parameters. The base filter includes a minimum gas price filter and a certifier filter. If a minimum gas prices contract data store is provided, the base filter is decorated with a `MinGasPriceContractTxFilter`. If a registrar address is provided, the base filter is decorated with a `TxCertifierFilter`. Finally, if a transaction permission contract is provided, the method creates a `PermissionBasedTxFilter` and decorates the base filter with it using a `CompositeTxFilter`. The resulting filter is returned.

The `CreateAuRaTxFilter` method is similar to `CreateAuRaTxFilterForProducer`, but it takes in a `baseTxFilter` parameter instead of `blocksConfig` and `minGasPricesContractDataStore`. It creates a base AuRa transaction filter using the `CreateBaseAuRaTxFilter` method and decorates it with a minimum gas price filter and a certifier filter. If a transaction permission contract is provided, the method creates a `PermissionBasedTxFilter` and decorates the base filter with it using a `CompositeTxFilter`. The resulting filter is returned.

The `CreateTxPermissionFilter` method creates a transaction permission filter if a transaction permission contract is provided. It takes in the `api` and `readOnlyTxProcessorSource` parameters and checks if the `ChainSpec` and `SpecProvider` properties are not null. If a transaction permission contract is provided, the method creates a `VersionedTransactionPermissionContract` and decorates it with a `PermissionBasedTxFilter` using a `CompositeTxFilter`. The resulting filter is returned.

The `CreateTxPrioritySources` method creates a tuple containing a `TxPriorityContract` and a `TxPriorityContract.LocalDataSource` if a transaction priority contract is provided. It takes in the `config`, `api`, and `readOnlyTxProcessorSource` parameters and checks if the `TxPriorityContractAddress` property is not null. If a transaction priority contract is provided, the method creates a `TxPriorityContract`. It also checks if the `TxPriorityConfigFilePath` property is not null. If a local data source is provided, the method creates a `TxPriorityContract.LocalDataSource`. The resulting tuple is returned.

The `CreateMinGasPricesDataStore` method creates a `DictionaryContractDataStore<TxPriorityContract.Destination>` if a transaction priority contract or local data source is provided. It takes in the `api`, `txPriorityContract`, and `localDataSource` parameters and checks if either of them is not null. If a transaction priority contract or local data source is provided, the method creates a `DictionaryContractDataStore<TxPriorityContract.Destination>` and returns it.

Overall, the `TxAuRaFilterBuilders` class provides methods for creating transaction filters for the AuRa consensus algorithm. These filters are used to validate transactions and ensure that they meet certain criteria before they are included in a new block. The methods take in various parameters and use them to create different types of filters, including minimum gas price filters, certifier filters, and permission-based filters. These filters are then combined using composite filters to create a final transaction filter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CreateFilter` delegate and how is it used in this code?
   
   The `CreateFilter` delegate is used to create a new filter based on an original filter and a potential fallback filter if the original filter was not used. It is used in the `CreateBaseAuRaTxFilter` method to decorate the original filter with a `MinGasPriceContractTxFilter` or a `TxCertifierFilter` depending on certain conditions.

2. What is the purpose of the `CreateTxPermissionFilter` method and when is it called?
   
   The `CreateTxPermissionFilter` method is used to create a transaction permission filter if the `TransactionPermissionContract` parameter is specified in the `ChainSpec`. It is called when creating an AuRa transaction filter for a producer.

3. What is the purpose of the `CreateMinGasPricesDataStore` method and when is it called?
   
   The `CreateMinGasPricesDataStore` method is used to create a `DictionaryContractDataStore` for `TxPriorityContract.Destination` if either `TxPriorityContract` or `TxPriorityContract.LocalDataSource` is not null. It is called when creating an AuRa transaction filter for a producer.
