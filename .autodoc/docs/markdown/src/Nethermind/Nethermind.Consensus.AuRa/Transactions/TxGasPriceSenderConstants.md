The code above defines a static class called `TxGasPriceSenderConstants` that contains two constants related to gas prices for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind project. 

The first constant, `DefaultGasPrice`, is a `UInt256` value set to 20,000,000. This value represents the default gas price that will be used for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm if no other gas price is specified. 

The second constant, `DefaultPercentMultiplier`, is an unsigned integer set to 110. This value represents the default percentage multiplier that will be applied to the gas price for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

This class is likely used throughout the Nethermind project to ensure that transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm have a consistent default gas price and percentage multiplier. Developers can use these constants in their code to ensure that their transactions are using the expected gas price and multiplier values. 

For example, a developer could use the `DefaultGasPrice` constant in their code to set the gas price for a transaction like this:

```
using Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Transactions;
using Nethermind.Int256;

public class MyTransaction
{
    public void SendTransaction()
    {
        UInt256 gasPrice = TxGasPriceSenderConstants.DefaultGasPrice;
        // code to send transaction with default gas price
    }
}
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and consistent way to set default gas prices and percentage multipliers for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace?
   - A smart developer might ask what the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace is used for and what types or functions it contains.

2. What is the significance of the `TxGasPriceSenderConstants` class?
   - A smart developer might ask why the `TxGasPriceSenderConstants` class is static and what its purpose is within the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Transactions` namespace.

3. Why is the `DefaultGasPrice` value set to 20,000,000?
   - A smart developer might ask why the `DefaultGasPrice` value is set to 20,000,000 and whether this value is appropriate for the intended use case.
