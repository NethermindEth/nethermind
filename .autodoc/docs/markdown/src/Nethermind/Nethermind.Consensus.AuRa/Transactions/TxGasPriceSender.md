The `TxGasPriceSender` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for nonposdao AuRa chains. This class is responsible for sending transactions and setting the gas price for those transactions. 

The purpose of this class is to ensure that the gas price for transactions is set correctly. The gas price is estimated using the `IGasPriceOracle` interface, which provides an estimate of the current gas price. The `percentDelta` parameter is used to adjust the gas price estimate by a percentage. The default value for `percentDelta` is set to `TxGasPriceSenderConstants.DefaultPercentMultiplier`, which is a constant value defined elsewhere in the project.

The `SendTransaction` method is responsible for sending the transaction and setting the gas price. The `tx` parameter is the transaction to be sent, and the `txHandlingOptions` parameter is used to specify how the transaction should be handled. The method first calculates the estimated gas price using the `IGasPriceOracle` interface and the `percentDelta` parameter. It then sets the `DecodedMaxFeePerGas` and `GasPrice` properties of the transaction to the estimated gas price. Finally, it calls the `SendTransaction` method of the `_txSender` object, which is an instance of the `ITxSender` interface, to send the transaction.

This class is used in the larger project to ensure that transactions are sent with the correct gas price. It is specifically designed for nonposdao AuRa chains, where the validator pays for the transaction. By setting the gas price correctly, this class helps to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and that validators are not overcharged for transaction fees.

Example usage:

```
var txSender = new TxGasPriceSender(
    new DefaultTxSender(),
    new DefaultGasPriceOracle(),
    110);
var tx = new Transaction();
var txHandlingOptions = new TxHandlingOptions();
var result = await txSender.SendTransaction(tx, txHandlingOptions);
``` 

In this example, a new instance of the `TxGasPriceSender` class is created with a `DefaultTxSender` object and a `DefaultGasPriceOracle` object. The `percentDelta` parameter is set to `110`, which means that the estimated gas price will be increased by 10%. A new `Transaction` object is created, and the `SendTransaction` method of the `TxGasPriceSender` object is called with the transaction and handling options as parameters. The method returns a tuple containing the transaction hash and an optional `AcceptTxResult` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `TxGasPriceSender` which is used for nonposdao AuRa chains to pay for transactions using a gas price estimated by an oracle. It solves the problem of setting an appropriate gas price for transactions on the chain.

2. What other classes or modules does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other modules including `Nethermind.Core`, `Nethermind.Core.Crypto`, `Nethermind.Int256`, `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Eth.GasPrice`, and `Nethermind.TxPool`.

3. What is the significance of the `percentDelta` parameter in the constructor?
- The `percentDelta` parameter is used to adjust the gas price estimated by the oracle by a certain percentage. It is set to a default value of `TxGasPriceSenderConstants.DefaultPercentMultiplier` if not specified.
