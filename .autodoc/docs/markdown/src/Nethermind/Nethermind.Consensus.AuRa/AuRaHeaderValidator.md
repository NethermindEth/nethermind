The `AuRaHeaderValidator` class is a header validator for the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind blockchain project. It extends the `HeaderValidator` class and overrides the `ValidateGasLimitRange` method to add additional validation specific to the AuRa algorithm.

The constructor for `AuRaHeaderValidator` takes in several dependencies, including a `blockTree`, `sealValidator`, `specProvider`, `logManager`, and a list of `blockGasLimitContractTransitions`. The `blockTree` is an interface for accessing the blockchain data structure, the `sealValidator` is used to validate the block seal, the `specProvider` provides access to the blockchain specification, and the `logManager` is used for logging. The `blockGasLimitContractTransitions` list contains the block numbers at which the gas limit contract transitions occur.

The `ValidateGasLimitRange` method is called during header validation and checks that the gas limit of the current block is within a valid range. The method first checks if the current block number is in the `blockGasLimitContractTransitions` list. If it is, the method returns true without performing any further validation. If the block number is not in the list, the method calls the base `ValidateGasLimitRange` method to perform the default gas limit validation.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to validate block headers during the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `AuRaHeaderValidator` class is instantiated and used by other classes in the AuRa consensus algorithm to validate block headers. For example, the `AuRaBlockProcessor` class uses the `AuRaHeaderValidator` to validate block headers during block processing.

Example usage:
```
var blockTree = new BlockTree();
var sealValidator = new SealValidator();
var specProvider = new SpecProvider();
var logManager = new LogManager();
var blockGasLimitContractTransitions = new List<long> { 1000000, 2000000 };
var headerValidator = new AuRaHeaderValidator(blockTree, sealValidator, specProvider, logManager, blockGasLimitContractTransitions);

var header = new BlockHeader();
var parentHeader = new BlockHeader();
var spec = specProvider.GetSpec(header.Number);
var isValid = headerValidator.ValidateGasLimitRange(header, parentHeader, spec);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains a class called `AuRaHeaderValidator` which is a subclass of `HeaderValidator` and is used for validating block headers in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What are the parameters passed to the constructor of `AuRaHeaderValidator` and what do they represent?
    
    The constructor of `AuRaHeaderValidator` takes in an `IBlockTree` instance, an `ISealValidator` instance, an `ISpecProvider` instance, an `ILogManager` instance, and an `IList<long>` of block gas limit contract transitions. These parameters represent the dependencies required for validating block headers in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

3. What is the purpose of the `ValidateGasLimitRange` method in `AuRaHeaderValidator`?
    
    The `ValidateGasLimitRange` method in `AuRaHeaderValidator` is an overridden method from the `HeaderValidator` class and is used to validate the gas limit range of a block header. It checks if the block number is present in the list of block gas limit contract transitions and if not, it calls the base implementation of `ValidateGasLimitRange` to perform the validation.
