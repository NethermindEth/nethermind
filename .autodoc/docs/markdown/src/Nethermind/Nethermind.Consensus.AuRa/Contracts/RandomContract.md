The `RandomContract` class is a smart contract that implements the `IRandomContract` interface. The purpose of this contract is to provide a random number generation mechanism for the AuRa consensus algorithm. The contract is activated at a specific block number and provides a set of functions that can be called by validators to commit their secret hash and reveal their random number.

The `IRandomContract` interface defines the following functions:
- `GetPhase`: returns the current phase and round number of the contract.
- `GetCommitAndCipher`: returns the hash and cipher of the validator's secret for a specific round.
- `CommitHash`: called by the validator to store a hash and cipher of their secret for a specific round.
- `RevealNumber`: called by the validator to reveal their random number for a specific round.

The `RandomContract` class implements these functions and provides additional helper functions to check the current phase, round number, and whether a validator has committed or revealed their secret for a specific round.

The `RandomContract` class inherits from the `Blockchain.Contracts.Contract` class and takes an `IAbiEncoder`, `Address`, `IReadOnlyTxProcessorSource`, `long`, and `ISigner` as constructor parameters. The `IAbiEncoder` is used to encode and decode function calls, the `Address` is the contract address, the `IReadOnlyTxProcessorSource` is used to read transactions from the blockchain, the `long` is the block number at which the contract is activated, and the `ISigner` is used to sign transactions.

The `GetPhase` function returns the current phase and round number of the contract. It checks whether the contract is activated and whether the current phase is a commit or reveal phase. If the current phase is a commit phase, it checks whether the validator has committed their secret hash and whether they have revealed their random number. If the current phase is a reveal phase, it checks whether the validator has revealed their random number. It returns the current phase and round number as a tuple.

The `GetCommitAndCipher` function returns the hash and cipher of the validator's secret for a specific round. It takes the parent block header and the round number as parameters and returns the hash and cipher as a tuple.

The `CommitHash` function is called by the validator to store a hash and cipher of their secret for a specific round. It takes the secret hash and cipher as parameters and returns a transaction to be included in a block.

The `RevealNumber` function is called by the validator to reveal their random number for a specific round. It takes the random number as a parameter and returns a transaction to be included in a block.

The `SentReveal`, `IsCommitted`, `CurrentCollectRound`, and `IsCommitPhase` functions are helper functions that check whether a validator has revealed their random number, committed their secret hash, the current round number, and whether the current phase is a commit phase, respectively.

Overall, the `RandomContract` class provides a secure and decentralized random number generation mechanism for the AuRa consensus algorithm. Validators can commit their secret hash and reveal their random number, and the contract ensures that the random number is generated fairly and transparently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IRandomContract` interface and how is it used in the `RandomContract` class?
   
   The `IRandomContract` interface defines the methods and properties that a contract must implement to participate in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `RandomContract` class implements this interface and provides the implementation for each method.

2. What is the purpose of the `Activation` property in the `RandomContract` class?

   The `Activation` property specifies the block number at which the contract becomes active. This is used to ensure that the contract is only used after it has been activated.

3. What is the purpose of the `SentReveal` method in the `RandomContract` class?

   The `SentReveal` method returns a boolean flag indicating whether the specified validator has revealed their number for the specified collection round. This is used to determine whether a validator has participated in the consensus algorithm and to prevent double voting.
