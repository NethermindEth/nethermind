The `DataContract` class is a generic implementation of the `IDataContract` interface in the `Nethermind` project. It is used to manage data contracts for the AuRa consensus algorithm. The class is internal, which means it can only be accessed within the same assembly.

The `DataContract` class has two constructors, both of which take two parameters. The first constructor takes a `Func<BlockHeader, IEnumerable<T>>` delegate and a `TryGetChangesFromBlockDelegate` delegate. The second constructor takes a `Func<BlockHeader, IEnumerable<T>>` delegate and a `Func<BlockHeader, TxReceipt[], IEnumerable<T>>` delegate. The second constructor is a shorthand for the first constructor, where the `TryGetChangesFromBlockDelegate` is created using a static method called `GetTryGetChangesFromBlock`.

The `TryGetChangesFromBlockDelegate` delegate is used to get the changes made to the data contract from a block. It takes a `BlockHeader` object and an array of `TxReceipt` objects as input parameters, and returns a Boolean value indicating whether any changes were made to the data contract. If changes were made, it also returns an `IEnumerable<T>` object containing the changed items.

The `IncrementalChanges` property is a Boolean value indicating whether the data contract supports incremental changes. If it does, the `TryGetChangesFromBlock` method is used to get the changes made to the data contract from a block. If it doesn't, the `GetAllItemsFromBlock` method is used to get all the items in the data contract from a block.

The `GetAllItemsFromBlock` method takes a `BlockHeader` object as input parameter and returns an `IEnumerable<T>` object containing all the items in the data contract from the specified block.

The `TryGetItemsChangedFromBlock` method takes a `BlockHeader` object and an array of `TxReceipt` objects as input parameters, and returns a Boolean value indicating whether any changes were made to the data contract. If changes were made, it also returns an `IEnumerable<T>` object containing the changed items.

Overall, the `DataContract` class provides a way to manage data contracts for the AuRa consensus algorithm in the `Nethermind` project. It allows for getting all the items in a data contract from a block, as well as getting the changes made to a data contract from a block. The class is generic, which means it can be used with any type of data contract.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DataContract` class?
    
    The `DataContract` class is an internal class that implements the `IDataContract` interface and provides methods for getting all items from a block and getting items changed from a block.

2. What is the purpose of the `TryGetChangesFromBlockDelegate` delegate?
    
    The `TryGetChangesFromBlockDelegate` delegate is used to define a method that tries to get changes from a block and returns a Boolean value indicating whether any changes were found.

3. What is the purpose of the `IncrementalChanges` property?
    
    The `IncrementalChanges` property is a Boolean value that indicates whether the `DataContract` instance supports incremental changes or not. If it does, it means that it can return only the items that have changed since the last block.
