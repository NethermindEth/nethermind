The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is a subclass of `ContractDataStore` and is used to store contract data in a local data source. It is designed to work with the AuRa consensus algorithm and is part of the Nethermind project. 

The class takes in a `ILocalDataSource<IEnumerable<T>>` object in its constructor, which is used to load and store local data. The `LoadLocalData` method is called when the local data source is changed, which removes the old local data from the collection, loads the new local data, and inserts it into the collection. The `RemoveOldContractItemsFromCollection` method is overridden to insert the local data into the collection after removing old contract items.

The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class also has an event called `Loaded`, which is invoked when the local data is loaded. This event can be used to notify other parts of the application that the local data has been updated.

This class is useful in situations where contract data needs to be stored locally and updated frequently. For example, in a decentralized application, contract data can be stored on the blockchain, but it may be more efficient to store frequently accessed data locally to reduce the number of blockchain queries. 

Here is an example of how to use the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class:

```csharp
// create a local data source
var localDataSource = new MyLocalDataSource<IEnumerable<MyContractData>>();

// create a contract data store with local data
var contractDataStore = new ContractDataStoreWithLocalData<MyContractData>(
    myContractDataStoreCollection, 
    myDataContract, 
    myBlockTree, 
    myReceiptFinder, 
    myLogManager, 
    localDataSource);

// subscribe to the Loaded event
contractDataStore.Loaded += OnLoaded;

// load the local data
localDataSource.Data = LoadLocalData();

// dispose the contract data store when done
contractDataStore.Dispose();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class?
- The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is a subclass of `ContractDataStore` that adds support for local data storage and retrieval.

2. What is the significance of the `Loaded` event?
- The `Loaded` event is raised when the local data has been loaded into the contract data store, indicating that the data is ready for use.

3. What is the purpose of the `LoadLocalData` method?
- The `LoadLocalData` method loads the local data into the contract data store by removing any existing data, inserting the new data, and raising the `Loaded` event.
