The `TxPriorityContract` class is a permission contract for transaction ordering in the Nethermind project's `ITxPool`. The class is a partial implementation of the `Contract` class and is used to manage the priority of transactions in the transaction pool. The class is defined in the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Contracts` namespace and is used to manage the priority of transactions in the transaction pool.

The `TxPriorityContract` class has three properties that are used to manage the priority of transactions in the transaction pool. These properties are `SendersWhitelist`, `MinGasPrices`, and `Priorities`. These properties are defined as `IDataContract` objects and are used to get and set the priority of transactions in the transaction pool.

The `TxPriorityContract` class has several methods that are used to manage the priority of transactions in the transaction pool. These methods include `GetSendersWhitelist`, `GetMinGasPrices`, `GetPriorities`, `PrioritySet`, `MinGasPriceSet`, `SendersWhitelistSet`, `DecodeAddresses`, `DecodeDestination`, `SetPriority`, `SetSendersWhitelist`, and `SetMinGasPrice`.

The `GetSendersWhitelist` method is used to get the list of senders that are whitelisted to send transactions to the transaction pool. The `GetMinGasPrices` method is used to get the minimum gas prices for transactions in the transaction pool. The `GetPriorities` method is used to get the priorities of transactions in the transaction pool.

The `PrioritySet` method is used to set the priority of transactions in the transaction pool. The `MinGasPriceSet` method is used to set the minimum gas prices for transactions in the transaction pool. The `SendersWhitelistSet` method is used to set the list of senders that are whitelisted to send transactions to the transaction pool.

The `DecodeAddresses` method is used to decode the list of addresses returned by the `GetSendersWhitelist` method. The `DecodeDestination` method is used to decode the destination of a transaction.

The `SetPriority` method is used to set the priority of a transaction in the transaction pool. The `SetSendersWhitelist` method is used to set the list of senders that are whitelisted to send transactions to the transaction pool. The `SetMinGasPrice` method is used to set the minimum gas prices for transactions in the transaction pool.

Overall, the `TxPriorityContract` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's transaction pool management system. It provides a way to manage the priority of transactions in the transaction pool and ensures that the transaction pool is operating efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains the implementation of a permission contract for transaction ordering in the ITxPool of the Nethermind blockchain node, using the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code file depends on several other modules within the Nethermind project, including Nethermind.Abi, Nethermind.Blockchain.Contracts, Nethermind.Blockchain.Find, Nethermind.Core, Nethermind.Evm, Nethermind.Evm.TransactionProcessing, Nethermind.Facade, and Nethermind.TxPool. It also uses the System and System.Collections.Generic namespaces.

3. What methods are available for interacting with this contract?
    
    This contract provides several methods for interacting with it, including GetSendersWhitelist, GetMinGasPrices, GetPriorities, SetPriority, SetSendersWhitelist, and SetMinGasPrice. It also exposes three IDataContract properties for accessing the SendersWhitelist, MinGasPrices, and Priorities data.
