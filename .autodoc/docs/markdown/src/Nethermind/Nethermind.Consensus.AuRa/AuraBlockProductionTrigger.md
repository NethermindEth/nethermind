The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the AuRa consensus algorithm. This class extends the `BuildBlocksInALoop` class and provides additional functionality for block production in the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

The purpose of this class is to produce blocks in a loop, with each iteration of the loop corresponding to a specific step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface is used to calculate the time to the next step in the algorithm. The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class uses this interface to determine the time to the next step and waits for that amount of time before producing the next block. 

The `ProducerLoopStep` method is overridden in this class to implement the additional functionality required for the AuRa consensus algorithm. This method creates a `CancellationTokenSource` to be able to cancel the current step block production if needed. It then calculates the time to the next step and waits for that amount of time using the `TaskExt.DelayAtLeast` method. After waiting for the required time, it tries to produce a block using the `base.ProducerLoopStep` method. If the block production of the previous step was not completed, it cancels it using the `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel` method. 

This class can be used in the larger project to implement the AuRa consensus algorithm. It provides a way to produce blocks in a loop, with each iteration of the loop corresponding to a specific step in the algorithm. This allows the algorithm to progress through the different steps and reach consensus on the next block to be added to the blockchain. 

Example usage of this class:

```
IAuRaStepCalculator auRaStepCalculator = new AuRaStepCalculator();
ILogManager logManager = new LogManager();
BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps buildBlocksOnAuRaSteps = new BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps(auRaStepCalculator, logManager);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class and how does it relate to the `BuildBlocksInALoop` class?
- The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class is a subclass of `BuildBlocksInALoop` and is used to build blocks in a loop according to the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

2. What is the `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface and how is it used in this code?
- The `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface is used to calculate the time until the next step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. In this code, the `TimeToNextStep` property of the `_auRaStepCalculator` instance is used to determine the delay before the next block is produced.

3. What happens if the block production of the previous step is not completed when it is time to move on to the next step?
- If the block production of the previous step is not completed when it is time to move on to the next step, the `stepTokenSource.Cancel()` method is called to cancel the current step block production.
