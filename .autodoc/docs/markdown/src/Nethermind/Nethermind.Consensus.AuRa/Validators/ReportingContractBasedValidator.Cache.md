The code provided is a partial class called `ReportingContractBasedValidator` that contains a nested class called `Cache`. The purpose of this class is to provide a cache for storing and retrieving reports related to the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

The `Cache` class contains three fields: `PersistentReports`, `_lastBlockReports`, and `MaxQueuedReports`. `PersistentReports` is a linked list that stores `PersistentReport` objects. `_lastBlockReports` is an instance of the `LruCache` class, which is a cache that stores key-value pairs in memory. The keys are tuples that consist of a `Validator` address, a `ReportType`, and a `BlockNumber`. The values are boolean values that indicate whether a report has already been made for a given key. `MaxQueuedReports` is a constant that determines the maximum number of reports that can be stored in the cache.

The `Cache` class also contains a single method called `AlreadyReported`. This method takes three parameters: a `ReportType`, an `Address` object representing a validator, and a `long` value representing a block number. The method checks whether a report has already been made for the given parameters by looking up the corresponding key in the `_lastBlockReports` cache. If a value is found, the method returns `true`, indicating that a report has already been made. If no value is found, the method adds a new key-value pair to the cache and returns `false`, indicating that a report has not yet been made.

This cache is likely used in the larger project to improve the efficiency of the consensus algorithm by reducing the number of duplicate reports that are made. By storing previously made reports in memory, the algorithm can quickly check whether a report has already been made for a given validator and block number, without having to perform expensive computations or queries. This can help to reduce the overall processing time and improve the performance of the consensus algorithm. 

Example usage of the `AlreadyReported` method:

```
Cache cache = new Cache();
ReportType reportType = ReportType.Finality;
Address validator = new Address("0x1234567890abcdef");
long blockNumber = 12345;

bool alreadyReported = cache.AlreadyReported(reportType, validator, blockNumber);
if (alreadyReported)
{
    Console.WriteLine("A report has already been made for this validator and block number.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("No report has been made for this validator and block number yet.");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class?
- The `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class is a partial class that is part of the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Validators` namespace and is likely related to consensus validation in the AuRa protocol.

2. What is the `Cache` class used for?
- The `Cache` class is a nested class within the `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class and appears to be used for caching and checking whether a report has already been made for a given validator, report type, and block number.

3. What is the `LruCache` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `LruCache` class is a generic cache implementation that uses a least-recently-used eviction policy. In this code, it is used to store and retrieve whether a report has already been made for a given validator, report type, and block number.
