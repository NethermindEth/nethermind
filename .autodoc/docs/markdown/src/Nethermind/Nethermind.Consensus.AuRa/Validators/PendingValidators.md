The `PendingValidators` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The purpose of this class is to represent a list of validators that are pending for a particular block. It contains information about the block number, block hash, and the addresses of the validators.

The `PendingValidators` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `blockNumber`, `blockHash`, and `addresses`. The `blockNumber` parameter is a long integer that represents the number of the block for which the validators are pending. The `blockHash` parameter is an instance of the `Keccak` class that represents the hash of the block. The `addresses` parameter is an array of `Address` instances that represent the addresses of the validators.

The `PendingValidators` class also has four properties: `Addresses`, `BlockNumber`, `BlockHash`, and `AreFinalized`. The `Addresses` property is a read-only property that returns the array of `Address` instances passed to the constructor. The `BlockNumber` property is a read-only property that returns the block number passed to the constructor. The `BlockHash` property is a read-only property that returns the block hash passed to the constructor. The `AreFinalized` property is a read-write property that indicates whether the validators in the list have been finalized.

The `PendingValidators` class also has a static constructor that registers a `PendingValidatorsDecoder` instance with the `Rlp.Decoders` dictionary. This allows instances of the `PendingValidators` class to be deserialized from RLP-encoded data.

In the larger project, the `PendingValidators` class is used to represent the list of validators that are pending for a particular block in the AuRa consensus algorithm. This information is used to determine which validators are eligible to participate in block validation and consensus. The `PendingValidators` class is also used in the serialization and deserialization of data related to the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

Example usage:

```
Address[] addresses = new Address[] { new Address("0x123"), new Address("0x456") };
long blockNumber = 12345;
Keccak blockHash = new Keccak("0xabcdef");
PendingValidators pendingValidators = new PendingValidators(blockNumber, blockHash, addresses);
bool areFinalized = pendingValidators.AreFinalized;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PendingValidators` class?
- The `PendingValidators` class is used to store information about pending validators for the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the significance of the `Rlp.Decoders` line in the `static PendingValidators()` method?
- The `Rlp.Decoders` line registers a custom decoder for the `PendingValidators` class with the RLP serialization library.

3. What is the meaning of the `AreFinalized` property?
- The `AreFinalized` property is a boolean flag that indicates whether the pending validators have been finalized for the current block.
