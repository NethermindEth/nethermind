The `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` class is a part of the Nethermind project and implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. This class is responsible for providing a better peer strategy for the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

The `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` class has four methods that implement the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. The `Compare` method compares two peers based on their total difficulty and block number. The `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method checks if the best peer is better than the local chain based on their total difficulty and block number. The `IsDesiredPeer` method checks if the best peer is a desired peer based on their total difficulty and block number. The `IsLowerThanTerminalTotalDifficulty` method checks if the total difficulty of a peer is lower than the terminal total difficulty.

The `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` class takes an instance of `IBetterPeerStrategy` and `ILogManager` as parameters in its constructor. The `IBetterPeerStrategy` instance is used to compare peers and check if the best peer is better than the local chain. The `ILogManager` instance is used to get the class logger.

The `IsDesiredPeer` method has additional logic specific to the AuRa consensus algorithm. It checks if the best peer is a desired peer and ignores parity when it says it has the same block level with higher difficulty in AuRa. This is because if it's a different block that has already been imported, but on the same level, it will have lower difficulty (AuRa specific). If the previous block has been imported, then the current block should not be imported. If the best peer is an outlier, then it is ignored.

Overall, the `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` class provides a better peer strategy for the AuRa consensus algorithm by implementing the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface and adding additional logic specific to the AuRa consensus algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a class called `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` which implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface.

2. What is the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface and what methods does it define?
- The `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface is not defined in this code file, but it is implemented by the `AuRaBetterPeerStrategy` class. It defines methods such as `Compare`, `IsBetterThanLocalChain`, `IsDesiredPeer`, and `IsLowerThanTerminalTotalDifficulty`.

3. What is the significance of the comments in the `IsDesiredPeer` method?
- The comments explain that the code is specifically designed to handle a situation where Parity/OpenEthereum is lying about having the same block level with higher difficulty in AuRa. It also mentions that reorg can be ignored for one round if the previous block was accepted fine.
