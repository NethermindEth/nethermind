This code defines a set of interfaces and an extension method related to the activation of a consensus algorithm in the Nethermind blockchain platform. The interfaces are used to specify the block number at which a particular consensus algorithm is activated, and the extension method is used to check whether a given block header is valid for the activation of a consensus algorithm.

The `IActivatedAt` interface is the base interface that defines a single property `Activation` of type `long`. This property specifies the block number at which a consensus algorithm is activated. The `IActivatedAt<T>` interface is a generic interface that inherits from `IActivatedAt` and specifies the type of the `Activation` property. The `IActivatedAtBlock` interface is a specialized interface that inherits from `IActivatedAt` and adds a read-only property `ActivationBlock` that returns the value of the `Activation` property. This interface is used to specify the activation block of a consensus algorithm.

The `ActivatedAtBlockExtensions` class defines a single extension method `BlockActivationCheck` that takes an object of type `IActivatedAtBlock` and a `BlockHeader` object as input parameters. This method checks whether the `ActivationBlock` property of the `IActivatedAtBlock` object is valid for the given `BlockHeader` object. If the `ActivationBlock` property is greater than the block number of the parent block of the given `BlockHeader` object, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown with a message indicating that the consensus algorithm is not active for the given block.

This code is used in the larger Nethermind project to specify and activate consensus algorithms at specific block numbers. The `IActivatedAtBlock` interface is implemented by various consensus algorithm classes in the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Contracts` namespace, which specify the activation block of the consensus algorithm. The `ActivatedAtBlockExtensions` class is used to check whether a given block header is valid for the activation of a consensus algorithm. For example, the following code snippet shows how the `BlockActivationCheck` method can be used to check the activation of the AuRa consensus algorithm:

```
using Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa;
using Nethermind.Core;

// create a new AuRa consensus algorithm object
var auRa = new AuRaConsensus();

// get the parent block header
var parentHeader = GetParentBlockHeader();

// check whether the AuRa consensus algorithm is active for the next block
auRa.BlockActivationCheck(parentHeader);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IActivatedAt` interface and its derived interfaces?
- The `IActivatedAt` interface and its derived interfaces define a contract for objects that have an activation time or block number, with `IActivatedAtBlock` specifically defining an activation block property.

2. What is the `BlockActivationCheck` method in the `ActivatedAtBlockExtensions` class used for?
- The `BlockActivationCheck` method is used to check if an object implementing the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface is active for a given block, based on its activation block property and the parent block header.

3. What is the significance of the `LGPL-3.0-only` license specified in the file header?
- The `LGPL-3.0-only` license is a type of open source license that allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the code, but requires any derivative works to also be licensed under the same terms.
