The `ContractRewriter` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for rewriting smart contracts on the blockchain. The purpose of this class is to allow for the modification of smart contracts at specific block heights. This is useful for implementing protocol upgrades or fixing bugs in smart contracts.

The class takes in a dictionary of contract overrides as a parameter in its constructor. The dictionary is structured such that the keys are block numbers and the values are dictionaries of contract addresses and their new bytecode. This allows for the specification of which contracts should be modified and at which block height.

The `RewriteContracts` method is responsible for actually rewriting the contracts. It takes in the block number, an `IStateProvider` instance, and an `IReleaseSpec` instance as parameters. The `IStateProvider` instance is used to update the bytecode of the contracts specified in the contract overrides dictionary. The `IReleaseSpec` instance is used to update the code hash of the contracts after the bytecode has been updated.

The method first checks if there are any contract overrides for the specified block number. If there are, it iterates over each contract override and updates the bytecode of the contract using the `UpdateCode` method of the `IStateProvider` instance. It then calculates the new code hash using the `Keccak` hash function and updates the code hash of the contract using the `UpdateCodeHash` method of the `IStateProvider` instance.

Overall, the `ContractRewriter` class is an important component of the Nethermind project as it allows for the modification of smart contracts at specific block heights. This is useful for implementing protocol upgrades or fixing bugs in smart contracts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractRewriter` class?
- The `ContractRewriter` class is responsible for rewriting contracts based on overrides provided in a dictionary.

2. What is the significance of the `blockNumber` parameter in the `RewriteContracts` method?
- The `blockNumber` parameter is used to determine if there are any contract overrides for the given block number.

3. What is the role of the `IReleaseSpec` parameter in the `RewriteContracts` method?
- The `IReleaseSpec` parameter is used to update the code hash of the contract override using the `UpdateCodeHash` method of the `stateProvider` object.
