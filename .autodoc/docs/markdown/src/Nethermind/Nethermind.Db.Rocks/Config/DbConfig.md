The `DbConfig` class is a configuration class that defines the default settings for various databases used in the Nethermind project. The class implements the `IDbConfig` interface and contains properties that define the buffer size, cache size, and other options for each database. 

The class contains properties for various databases used in the Nethermind project, including `ReceiptsDb`, `BlocksDb`, `HeadersDb`, `BlockInfosDb`, `PendingTxsDb`, `CodeDb`, `BloomDb`, `WitnessDb`, `CanonicalHashTrieDb`, and `MetadataDb`. Each of these properties defines the default settings for the corresponding database. For example, the `BlocksDbWriteBufferSize` property defines the default write buffer size for the `BlocksDb` database.

The class also contains properties for general database settings, such as `RecycleLogFileNum`, `WriteAheadLogSync`, `EnableDbStatistics`, `EnableMetricsUpdater`, and `StatsDumpPeriodSec`. These properties define settings that apply to all databases used in the Nethermind project.

Developers can use this class to customize the default settings for each database used in the Nethermind project. For example, if a developer wants to increase the write buffer size for the `BlocksDb` database, they can set the `BlocksDbWriteBufferSize` property to a larger value. 

Here is an example of how a developer can customize the default settings for the `BlocksDb` database:

```
var dbConfig = new DbConfig();
dbConfig.BlocksDbWriteBufferSize = (ulong)32.MiB();
```

In this example, the developer creates a new instance of the `DbConfig` class and sets the `BlocksDbWriteBufferSize` property to 32 MB. This will override the default value of 8 MB for the `BlocksDbWriteBufferSize` property.

Overall, the `DbConfig` class provides a convenient way for developers to customize the default settings for various databases used in the Nethermind project. By modifying the properties of this class, developers can optimize the performance of the databases based on their specific needs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `DbConfig` that contains properties for configuring various databases used in the Nethermind project, such as the blocks database and receipts database.

2. What are some of the default values for the database configuration properties?
- Some default values include a write buffer size of 16 MiB for the main database, a block cache size of 64 MiB for the main database, and a write buffer size of 8 MiB for the receipts database.

3. Are there any properties that are not currently being used or are marked as TODO?
- Yes, there is a property called `CanonicalHashTrieDb` that is marked as TODO and has default values that may need to be customized based on profiling.
