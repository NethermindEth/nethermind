The `SessionMonitorTests` class is a test suite for the `SessionMonitor` class in the Nethermind project. The `SessionMonitor` class is responsible for monitoring and managing P2P network sessions. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `SessionMonitor` class is functioning correctly.

The `SessionMonitorTests` class contains two test methods: `Will_unregister_on_disconnect` and `Will_keep_pinging`. The `SetUp` method is called before each test method and initializes two `IPingSender` objects, `_pingSender` and `_noPong`, which are used to simulate pinging and ponging between network nodes.

The `Will_unregister_on_disconnect` test method creates a new `SessionMonitor` object and adds a new `ISession` object to it. The `ISession` object is then marked as disconnected, which should cause it to be unregistered from the `SessionMonitor`. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the `SessionMonitor` correctly unregisters disconnected sessions.

The `Will_keep_pinging` test method creates two `ISession` objects, one of which is unresponsive to pings. The `SessionMonitor` is then started and runs for 300 milliseconds, during which time it should be pinging both sessions. After the `SessionMonitor` is stopped, the test checks that the `_pingSender` object received a ping from the responsive session and that the `_noPong` object did not receive a ping from the unresponsive session. The test also checks that the state of the sessions is correct. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the `SessionMonitor` correctly pings and manages sessions.

The `CreateSession` and `CreateUnresponsiveSession` methods are helper methods used to create `ISession` objects for testing. These methods create new `Session` objects with specific parameters and return them.

Overall, the `SessionMonitorTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's testing suite, as it ensures that the `SessionMonitor` class is functioning correctly and managing P2P network sessions as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SessionMonitor` class?
- The `SessionMonitor` class is responsible for managing and monitoring network sessions, including adding and removing sessions and sending pings to check for responsiveness.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `SessionMonitorTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `SessionMonitorTests` class can be run in parallel, which can improve test execution time.

3. What is the purpose of the `Explicit` attribute on the `Will_keep_pinging` test method?
- The `Explicit` attribute indicates that the `Will_keep_pinging` test method should not be run automatically, but only when explicitly requested, as it is known to fail on the Travis CI platform.
