The `PooledTxsRequestorTests` class is a unit test suite for the `PooledTxsRequestor` class, which is part of the Nethermind project. The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is responsible for requesting pooled transactions from the transaction pool and filtering out transactions that have already been requested or are already in the pool. The `PooledTxsRequestorTests` class tests the various filtering scenarios to ensure that the `PooledTxsRequestor` class is working as expected.

The `PooledTxsRequestor` class takes an `ITxPool` instance as a constructor argument, which is used to query the transaction pool for transactions. The `RequestTransactions` method takes a callback function and a list of transaction hashes as arguments. The callback function is called with a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` instance, which contains a list of transaction hashes that were successfully retrieved from the transaction pool. The `RequestTransactions` method filters out transaction hashes that have already been requested or are already in the pool, and then queries the transaction pool for the remaining transaction hashes. The filtered transaction hashes are then sent to the callback function.

The `PooledTxsRequestorTests` class tests the various filtering scenarios by creating an instance of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class and calling the `RequestTransactions` method with different sets of transaction hashes. The `Send` method is used as the callback function, which simply stores the list of transaction hashes in the `_response` field. The test methods then assert that the `_response` field contains the expected list of transaction hashes.

In summary, the `PooledTxsRequestor` class is responsible for requesting pooled transactions from the transaction pool and filtering out transactions that have already been requested or are already in the pool. The `PooledTxsRequestorTests` class tests the various filtering scenarios to ensure that the `PooledTxsRequestor` class is working as expected. This class is an important part of the Nethermind project, as it is used to retrieve transactions from the transaction pool for further processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class?
- The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is responsible for requesting pooled transactions from the transaction pool based on a list of transaction hashes.

2. What is the purpose of the `filter_properly_*` test methods?
- The `filter_properly_*` test methods are testing the behavior of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class when filtering transaction hashes based on whether they are already pending, discovered, or present in the hash cache.

3. What is the purpose of the `ITxPool` interface and how is it used in this code?
- The `ITxPool` interface is used to mock a transaction pool in the tests, allowing for isolated testing of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class. It defines methods for adding, removing, and querying transactions in the pool.
