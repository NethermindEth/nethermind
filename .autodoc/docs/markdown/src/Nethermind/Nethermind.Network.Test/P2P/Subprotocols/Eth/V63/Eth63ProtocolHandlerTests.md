The `Eth63ProtocolHandlerTests` class is a test suite for the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class, which is responsible for handling the Ethereum subprotocol messages for version 63. The purpose of this code is to test the functionality of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class, specifically its ability to request and handle receipts, serve receipts requests, and send messages that are not larger than 2MB.

The `Can_request_and_handle_receipts` test method tests the ability of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` to request and handle receipts. It creates a new instance of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class and passes it a `Session` object, a `MessageSerializationService` object, and several other objects. It then creates a `StatusMessage` object and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It also creates a `ReceiptsMessage` object containing an array of receipts and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `ReceiptsMessage`. The test then calls the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It then calls the `GetReceipts` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with an array of `Keccak` hashes and a `CancellationToken`. Finally, it calls the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `ReceiptsMessage`. The test then asserts that the result of the `GetReceipts` method has a length of 1000.

The `Will_not_serve_receipts_requests_above_512` test method tests the ability of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` to reject receipts requests that contain more than 512 `Keccak` hashes. It creates a new instance of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class and passes it a `Session` object, a `MessageSerializationService` object, and several other objects. It then creates a `StatusMessage` object and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It also creates a `GetReceiptsMessage` object containing an array of 513 `Keccak` hashes and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `GetReceiptsMessage`. The test then calls the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It then asserts that calling the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `GetReceiptsMessage` throws an `EthSyncException`.

The `Will_not_send_messages_larger_than_2MB` test method tests the ability of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` to reject messages that are larger than 2MB. It creates a new instance of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class and passes it a `Session` object, a `MessageSerializationService` object, and several other objects. It then creates a `StatusMessage` object and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It also creates a `GetReceiptsMessage` object containing an array of 512 `Keccak` hashes and a `Packet` object containing the serialized `GetReceiptsMessage`. The test then sets up a mock `ISyncServer` object to return an array of receipts. It then calls the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `StatusMessage`. It then calls the `HandleMessage` method of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class with the `Packet` object containing the serialized `GetReceiptsMessage`. Finally, it asserts that the `DeliverMessage` method of the `Session` object was called with a `ReceiptsMessage` object that has a `TxReceipts` array with a length of 14.

In summary, the `Eth63ProtocolHandlerTests` class tests the functionality of the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class, specifically its ability to request and handle receipts, serve receipts requests, and send messages that are not larger than 2MB. These tests ensure that the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class is working correctly and can be used in the larger Nethermind project to handle Ethereum subprotocol messages for version 63.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Can_request_and_handle_receipts` test?
- The test checks if the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` can handle receipt requests and responses correctly.

2. Why is there a limit of 512 on receipt requests in the `Will_not_serve_receipts_requests_above_512` test?
- The test checks if the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` will throw an exception when a receipt request is made for more than 512 receipts, which is the maximum number of receipts that can be requested at once.

3. What is the purpose of the `Will_not_send_messages_larger_than_2MB` test?
- The test checks if the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` will limit the size of messages it sends to 2MB or less, and if it will correctly split larger messages into multiple packets.
