The `NodeStatsManagerTests` class is a unit test for the `NodeStatsManager` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this code is to test the functionality of the `NodeStatsManager` class, which is responsible for managing statistics for nodes in the network. 

The `should_remove_excessive_stats` method tests whether the `NodeStatsManager` correctly removes excessive stats for nodes. The test creates an instance of the `NodeStatsManager` class with a timer factory, a logger, and a limit of 3 nodes. It then creates an array of 3 `Node` objects with public keys and IP addresses. The `ReportSyncEvent` method is called on each node to report a sync event of type `SyncStarted`. 

Next, a new `Node` object is created with a different public key and IP address, and the `ReportHandshakeEvent` method is called on the `NodeStatsManager` to report a handshake event of type `ConnectionDirection.In`. The `GetCurrentReputation` method is then called on the `NodeStatsManager` with the `removedNode` object as a parameter to check that its reputation is not 0. 

After that, the `Elapsed` event of the timer is raised, which should trigger the removal of the excessive stats for the `removedNode` object. The `GetCurrentReputation` method is called again on the `NodeStatsManager` with the `removedNode` object as a parameter to check that its reputation is now 0. Finally, the `GetCurrentReputation` method is called on each node in the `nodes` array to check that their reputation is not 0. 

This test ensures that the `NodeStatsManager` class correctly removes excessive stats for nodes and maintains the reputation of the remaining nodes. It also demonstrates the use of NSubstitute for mocking dependencies and FluentAssertions for asserting test results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeStatsManager` class?
- The `NodeStatsManager` class is responsible for managing and reporting statistics related to nodes in the network.

2. What is the significance of the `should_remove_excessive_stats` test method?
- The `should_remove_excessive_stats` test method tests whether the `NodeStatsManager` class correctly removes excessive statistics for nodes after a certain period of time.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetCurrentReputation` method?
- The `GetCurrentReputation` method is used to retrieve the current reputation of a node, which is a measure of its reliability and trustworthiness in the network.
