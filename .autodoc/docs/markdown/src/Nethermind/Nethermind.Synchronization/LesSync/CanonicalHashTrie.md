The `CanonicalHashTrie` class is a subclass of the `PatriciaTree` class and is used to store and retrieve data in a trie data structure. The trie is used to store block headers and their corresponding total difficulties in the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to efficiently store and retrieve block header data in a way that is optimized for the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES).

The `CanonicalHashTrie` class has several methods that allow for the retrieval and storage of block header data. The `Set` method is used to store a block header and its corresponding total difficulty in the trie. The `Get` method is used to retrieve the total difficulty of a block header given its block number. The `BuildProof` method is used to generate a Merkle proof for a given block header. The `CommitSectionIndex` method is used to commit the root hash of a section of the trie to the database.

The `CanonicalHashTrie` class also has several private methods that are used to manage the trie data structure. The `GetKey` method is used to generate a key for a given block number. The `GetRootHashKey` method is used to generate a key for a given section of the trie. The `GetRootHash` method is used to retrieve the root hash of a given section of the trie. The `GetMaxSectionIndex` method is used to retrieve the maximum section index that has been committed to the database. The `SetMaxSectionIndex` method is used to set the maximum section index in the database.

Overall, the `CanonicalHashTrie` class provides a way to efficiently store and retrieve block header data in a trie data structure that is optimized for the Light Ethereum Subprotocol. This class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it provides a way to efficiently synchronize with the Ethereum blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CanonicalHashTrie` class?
- The `CanonicalHashTrie` class is a subclass of `PatriciaTree` and is used for building and storing a trie data structure for canonical hashes of block headers.

2. What is the significance of the `SectionSize` constant?
- The `SectionSize` constant is used to determine the number of block headers that are stored in each section of the trie. It is set to 32768, which is equivalent to 2^15.

3. Why are some methods and properties commented out?
- Some methods and properties are commented out because they are not currently being used or have not been fully implemented yet. These include methods for storing and retrieving root hashes and section indexes, as well as a property for getting the maximum section index.
