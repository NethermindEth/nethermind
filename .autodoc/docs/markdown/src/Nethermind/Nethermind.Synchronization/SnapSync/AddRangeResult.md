This code defines an enum called `AddRangeResult` within the `Nethermind.Synchronization.SnapSync` namespace. The purpose of this enum is to provide a set of possible results that can be returned when adding a range of data during the SnapSync process in the Nethermind project.

The `AddRangeResult` enum has four possible values:

1. `OK`: This value indicates that the range was added successfully.
2. `MissingRootHashInProofs`: This value indicates that the root hash of the range is missing in the proofs provided.
3. `DifferentRootHash`: This value indicates that the root hash of the range is different from the expected root hash.
4. `ExpiredRootHash`: This value indicates that the root hash of the range has expired and cannot be added.

This enum can be used in the larger Nethermind project to handle different scenarios that may occur when adding a range of data during the SnapSync process. For example, if the root hash of the range is missing in the proofs provided, the `MissingRootHashInProofs` value can be returned to indicate that the range cannot be added until the missing root hash is provided.

Here is an example of how this enum can be used in code:

```
AddRangeResult result = AddRange(data, proofs);

switch (result)
{
    case AddRangeResult.OK:
        Console.WriteLine("Range added successfully.");
        break;
    case AddRangeResult.MissingRootHashInProofs:
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot add range - missing root hash in proofs.");
        break;
    case AddRangeResult.DifferentRootHash:
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot add range - root hash is different from expected.");
        break;
    case AddRangeResult.ExpiredRootHash:
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot add range - root hash has expired.");
        break;
}
```

In this example, the `AddRange` method is called with `data` and `proofs` parameters, and the result is stored in the `result` variable. The `switch` statement is then used to handle each possible value of the `AddRangeResult` enum and display a message to the user indicating the result of the operation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Synchronization.SnapSync` namespace?
- The `Nethermind.Synchronization.SnapSync` namespace is likely related to synchronization and snapshot syncing in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the `AddRangeResult` enum used for?
- The `AddRangeResult` enum is used to represent the result of adding a range of data, with possible values including `OK`, `MissingRootHashInProofs`, `DifferentRootHash`, and `ExpiredRootHash`.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
- The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released, in this case the LGPL-3.0-only license.
