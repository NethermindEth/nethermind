The `SnapSyncBatch` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the SnapSync module. The purpose of this class is to represent a batch of requests and responses for synchronizing state data between nodes in the Ethereum network. 

The class contains several properties that represent different types of data that can be requested and received during the synchronization process. These properties include `AccountRangeRequest`, `AccountRangeResponse`, `StorageRangeRequest`, `StorageRangeResponse`, `CodesRequest`, `CodesResponse`, `AccountsToRefreshRequest`, and `AccountsToRefreshResponse`. 

The `AccountRangeRequest` and `AccountRangeResponse` properties are used to request and receive account data from other nodes. The `StorageRangeRequest` and `StorageRangeResponse` properties are used to request and receive storage data from other nodes. The `CodesRequest` and `CodesResponse` properties are used to request and receive contract code data from other nodes. The `AccountsToRefreshRequest` and `AccountsToRefreshResponse` properties are used to request and receive account data that needs to be refreshed. 

The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `SnapSyncBatch` object. If the `AccountRangeRequest` property is not null, the method returns the string representation of the `AccountRangeRequest` object. If the `StorageRangeRequest` property is not null, the method returns the string representation of the `StorageRangeRequest` object. If the `CodesRequest` property is not null, the method returns a string indicating the number of codes requested. If the `AccountsToRefreshRequest` property is not null, the method returns the string representation of the `AccountsToRefreshRequest` object. If none of the properties are set, the method returns a string indicating that the `SnapSyncBatch` object is empty. 

Overall, the `SnapSyncBatch` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's synchronization process. It allows nodes to request and receive different types of state data from other nodes, which is essential for maintaining a consistent view of the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SnapSyncBatch` class?
- The `SnapSyncBatch` class is used for storing and passing information related to snapshot synchronization.

2. What are the different types of requests and responses that can be stored in a `SnapSyncBatch` object?
- A `SnapSyncBatch` object can store `AccountRangeRequest` and `AccountRangeResponse`, `StorageRangeRequest` and `StorageRangeResponse`, `CodesRequest` and `CodesResponse`, and `AccountsToRefreshRequest` and `AccountsToRefreshResponse`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToString` method in the `SnapSyncBatch` class?
- The `ToString` method is used to convert a `SnapSyncBatch` object to a string representation. It returns a string that describes the type of request or response stored in the object. If the object is empty, it returns the string "Empty snap sync batch".
