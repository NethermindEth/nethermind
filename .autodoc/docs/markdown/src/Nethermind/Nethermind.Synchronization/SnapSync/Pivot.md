The `Pivot` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the SnapSync synchronization mechanism. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the current pivot header, which is the header that is used as a reference point for synchronization. The pivot header is updated periodically to ensure that the synchronization process is up-to-date.

The `Pivot` class has a private field `_blockTree` of type `IBlockTree`, which is an interface that represents a blockchain data structure. The class also has a private field `_bestHeader` of type `BlockHeader`, which represents the current pivot header. The class has a public property `Diff` that returns the difference between the number of the best suggested header and the number of the current pivot header.

The `Pivot` class has a constructor that takes an `IBlockTree` object and an `ILogManager` object as parameters. The constructor initializes the `_blockTree` field with the `IBlockTree` object and initializes the `_logger` field with the logger obtained from the `ILogManager` object.

The `Pivot` class has three public methods: `GetPivotHeader()`, `LogPivotChanged()`, and `UpdateHeaderForcefully()`. The `GetPivotHeader()` method returns the current pivot header. If the current pivot header is null or the distance between the best suggested header and the current pivot header is greater than or equal to `Constants.MaxDistanceFromHead - 35`, the method updates the pivot header and logs the change. The `LogPivotChanged()` method logs the pivot change. The `UpdateHeaderForcefully()` method updates the pivot header if there are too many empty responses.

Overall, the `Pivot` class is an important part of the SnapSync synchronization mechanism in the Nethermind project. It ensures that the synchronization process is up-to-date by keeping track of the current pivot header and updating it periodically.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Pivot` class?
    
    The `Pivot` class is used for managing the pivot header in the Nethermind synchronization process.

2. What is the significance of the `Diff` property?
    
    The `Diff` property returns the difference between the number of the best suggested header and the number of the current pivot header.

3. What is the purpose of the `UpdateHeaderForcefully` method?
    
    The `UpdateHeaderForcefully` method updates the pivot header to the best suggested header if there are too many empty responses.
