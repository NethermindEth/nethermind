The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for dispatching block body synchronization requests to peers. It extends the `SyncDispatcher` class and takes in a `ISyncFeed<BodiesSyncBatch>`, `ISyncPeerPool`, `IPeerAllocationStrategyFactory<BodiesSyncBatch>`, and `ILogManager` as constructor parameters.

The `Dispatch` method is responsible for sending the block body synchronization request to a peer. It takes in a `PeerInfo`, `BodiesSyncBatch`, and `CancellationToken` as parameters. The method first retrieves the `ISyncPeer` from the `PeerInfo` and sets the `ResponseSourcePeer` property of the `BodiesSyncBatch` to the `PeerInfo`. It then creates a list of `Keccak` hashes from the `BlockHash` property of each `BlockInfo` in the `BodiesSyncBatch`. If the list is empty, the method returns. Otherwise, it sends the block body synchronization request to the peer using the `GetBlockBodies` method and sets the `Response` property of the `BodiesSyncBatch` to the response. If the request takes longer than 1000ms, a debug log is outputted.

Overall, the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class plays an important role in the Nethermind project by facilitating the synchronization of block bodies between nodes in the network. It does this by dispatching block body synchronization requests to peers and handling the responses.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class?
    
    The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class is responsible for dispatching batches of block bodies synchronization requests to peers in parallel.

2. What dependencies does the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class have?
    
    The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class depends on `ISyncFeed<BodiesSyncBatch>`, `ISyncPeerPool`, `IPeerAllocationStrategyFactory<BodiesSyncBatch>`, and `ILogManager`.

3. What happens if the `GetBlockBodies` method call on a peer times out?
    
    If the `GetBlockBodies` method call on a peer times out, the method returns and logs a debug message indicating that the timeout occurred.
