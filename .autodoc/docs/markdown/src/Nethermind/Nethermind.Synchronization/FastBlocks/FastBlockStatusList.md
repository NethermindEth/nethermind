The `FastBlockStatusList` class is used to represent a list of `FastBlockStatus` values. It is designed to be used in the Nethermind project for synchronization of fast blocks. 

The class has two fields: `_statuses` and `_length`. `_statuses` is a byte array that stores the status of each block in the list. `_length` is the length of the list.

The constructor takes a `long` value that represents the length of the list. It calculates the size of the `_statuses` array based on the length of the list. Since each byte can store 4 statuses, the size of the array is calculated by dividing the length by 4 and rounding up if necessary. The constructor then initializes the `_statuses` array with the calculated size.

The class provides an indexer that allows access to the status of a block at a given index. The indexer uses bit shifting to retrieve and set the status of a block. When retrieving the status, the indexer first calculates the byte index and bit index of the block. It then retrieves the byte at the calculated index and shifts the bits to get the status of the block. When setting the status, the indexer first calculates the byte index and bit index of the block. It then sets the status of the block by shifting the bits and updating the byte at the calculated index.

The `ThrowIndexOutOfRange` method is a private helper method that throws an `IndexOutOfRangeException` if the index passed to the indexer is out of range.

The `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute is used to allow access to the `FastBlockStatusList` class from the `Nethermind.Synchronization.Test` assembly.

Overall, the `FastBlockStatusList` class provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve the status of blocks in a list. It is designed to be used in the Nethermind project for synchronization of fast blocks. An example usage of this class could be to keep track of the status of blocks during synchronization of the Ethereum blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FastBlockStatusList` class?
- The `FastBlockStatusList` class is used to store and retrieve status information for blocks in a fast and efficient manner.

2. What is the significance of the `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute?
- The `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute allows the `Nethermind.Synchronization.Test` assembly to access internal members of the `Nethermind.Synchronization.FastBlocks` namespace.

3. How are the block statuses stored in the `_statuses` byte array?
- Each byte in the `_statuses` array stores the status of 4 blocks, with each block's status represented by 2 bits. The status of a specific block can be retrieved or set using the index operator and bit manipulation.
