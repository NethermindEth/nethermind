The `SyncStatusList` class is a helper class used in the Nethermind project for fast block synchronization. It is responsible for keeping track of the status of blocks during synchronization. 

The class has three fields: `_queueSize`, `_blockTree`, and `_statuses`. `_queueSize` is a long integer that keeps track of the number of blocks that are currently being synchronized. `_blockTree` is an instance of the `IBlockTree` interface, which is used to find the canonical block information for a given block number. `_statuses` is an instance of the `FastBlockStatusList` class, which is used to keep track of the status of each block during synchronization.

The class has three public properties: `LowestInsertWithoutGaps`, `QueueSize`, and `GetInfosForBatch`. `LowestInsertWithoutGaps` is a long integer that represents the lowest block number that has not yet been inserted into the blockchain. `QueueSize` is a long integer that represents the number of blocks that are currently being synchronized. `GetInfosForBatch` is a method that takes an array of `BlockInfo?` objects and fills it with information about the blocks that need to be synchronized.

The class also has two public methods: `MarkInserted` and `MarkUnknown`. `MarkInserted` is used to mark a block as inserted into the blockchain. It increments the `_queueSize` field and sets the status of the block to `FastBlockStatus.Inserted`. `MarkUnknown` is used to mark a block as unknown. It sets the status of the block to `FastBlockStatus.Unknown`.

The `SyncStatusList` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to keep track of the status of blocks during synchronization. It is used in conjunction with other classes and interfaces to synchronize blocks between nodes in the network. Here is an example of how the `SyncStatusList` class might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
IBlockTree blockTree = new BlockTree();
long pivotNumber = 100;
long? lowestInserted = null;
SyncStatusList syncStatusList = new SyncStatusList(blockTree, pivotNumber, lowestInserted);

BlockInfo?[] blockInfos = new BlockInfo?[10];
syncStatusList.GetInfosForBatch(blockInfos);

long blockNumber = 50;
syncStatusList.MarkInserted(blockNumber);
``` 

In this example, we create a new instance of the `IBlockTree` interface and initialize it with some data. We then create a new instance of the `SyncStatusList` class and pass in the `IBlockTree` instance, a pivot number, and a lowest inserted number. We then call the `GetInfosForBatch` method and pass in an array of `BlockInfo?` objects. This method fills the array with information about the blocks that need to be synchronized. We then mark a block as inserted using the `MarkInserted` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncStatusList` class?
    
    The `SyncStatusList` class is used to keep track of the synchronization status of blocks in the Nethermind blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `LowestInsertWithoutGaps` property?
    
    The `LowestInsertWithoutGaps` property represents the lowest block number that has not yet been inserted into the blockchain, without any gaps in the sequence of block numbers.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetInfosForBatch` method?
    
    The `GetInfosForBatch` method is used to retrieve block information for a batch of blocks, and update their synchronization status in the `SyncStatusList`.
