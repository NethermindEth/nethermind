The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for synchronizing transaction receipts between nodes in a blockchain network. It is located in the `Nethermind.Synchronization.FastBlocks` namespace and inherits from the `FastBlocksBatch` class.

The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class has two properties: `Infos` and `Response`. The `Infos` property is an array of `BlockInfo` objects that represent the blocks for which transaction receipts are being synchronized. The `Response` property is a two-dimensional array of `TxReceipt` objects that represent the transaction receipts for each block in the `Infos` array. The `Response` property is nullable and can be set to null.

The constructor of the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class takes an array of `BlockInfo` objects as a parameter and initializes the `Infos` property with it.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project for synchronizing transaction receipts between nodes in a blockchain network. When a node receives a request for transaction receipts from another node, it creates an instance of the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class and populates the `Infos` property with the requested block information. The node then sends the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` object to the requesting node, which populates the `Response` property with the transaction receipts for each block in the `Infos` array.

Here is an example of how the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class can be used in the Nethermind project:

```
BlockInfo[] blockInfos = new BlockInfo[] { new BlockInfo(1), new BlockInfo(2), new BlockInfo(3) };
ReceiptsSyncBatch receiptsBatch = new ReceiptsSyncBatch(blockInfos);
// send receiptsBatch object to another node
// receive response from the other node and access transaction receipts
TxReceipt[][] response = receiptsBatch.Response;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class?
- The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class is a subclass of `FastBlocksBatch` and is used for synchronizing transaction receipts for a batch of blocks.

2. What is the significance of the `BlockInfo` and `TxReceipt` types?
- `BlockInfo` is a type from the `Nethermind.Core` namespace that contains information about a block, while `TxReceipt` is a type that represents the receipt of a transaction.

3. Why are the `Response` property and the `TxReceipt` array nullable?
- The `Response` property is nullable because it may not be set until the batch is processed, and the `TxReceipt` array is nullable because there may not be any receipts for a particular block.
