The code provided is an interface for a synchronization server in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this interface is to define the methods that a synchronization server must implement in order to synchronize with other nodes on the network.

The interface includes methods for hinting a block, adding a new block, stopping notifications to peers about new blocks, retrieving transaction receipts, finding a block by its hash, finding the lowest common ancestor of two blocks, building a Canonical Hash Trie (CHT), retrieving the CHT, finding a hash by its block number, finding block headers, retrieving node data, getting the number of peers, retrieving the network ID, retrieving the genesis block header, retrieving the current head block header, and retrieving block witness hashes.

The `ISyncServer` interface is implemented by various synchronization servers in the Nethermind project, such as the `FastSyncServer` and `LesServer`. These servers use the methods defined in the interface to synchronize with other nodes on the network.

For example, the `AddNewBlock` method is used to add a new block to the synchronization server. This method takes a `Block` object and an `ISyncPeer` object as parameters. The `Block` object represents the block to be added, while the `ISyncPeer` object represents the node that sent the block to the synchronization server. The synchronization server then uses this block to update its state and synchronize with other nodes on the network.

Another example is the `GetNodeData` method, which is used to retrieve node data from the synchronization server. This method takes a list of `Keccak` objects as a parameter, which represent the keys of the node data to be retrieved. The `NodeDataType` parameter is used to specify the type of node data to be retrieved, such as code or state data.

Overall, the `ISyncServer` interface is an important component of the Nethermind project, as it defines the methods that synchronization servers must implement in order to synchronize with other nodes on the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ISyncServer` interface?
- The `ISyncServer` interface defines a set of methods and properties that a synchronization server must implement in order to synchronize with other nodes on the network.

2. What are the differences between `FastSync` and `LesSync`?
- `FastSync` and `LesSync` are two different synchronization methods used by Nethermind. `FastSync` is a faster but less secure method that downloads only the block headers and state data, while `LesSync` is a slower but more secure method that downloads the entire blockchain.

3. What is the `CanonicalHashTrie` and what is its purpose?
- The `CanonicalHashTrie` is a data structure used by Nethermind to store the state of the blockchain. The `BuildCHT` method is used to build the `CanonicalHashTrie`, and the `GetCHT` method is used to retrieve it.
