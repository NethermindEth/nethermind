The `StateSyncBatch` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the FastSync module for synchronizing the state of Ethereum nodes. The purpose of this class is to represent a batch of state sync requests that are sent to a peer node and the corresponding responses received from that peer node. 

The class has a constructor that takes in three parameters: `stateRoot`, `nodeDataType`, and `requestedNodes`. `stateRoot` is the Keccak hash of the state root that is being synchronized. `nodeDataType` is an enum that specifies the type of data being synchronized, such as account or storage data. `requestedNodes` is a list of `StateSyncItem` objects that represent the nodes whose data is being requested.

The class has several properties that provide information about the state sync batch. `NodeDataType` is a read-only property that returns the type of data being synchronized. `StateRoot` is a property that returns the Keccak hash of the state root being synchronized. `RequestedNodes` is a nullable list of `StateSyncItem` objects that represent the nodes whose data is being requested. `Responses` is a nullable array of byte arrays that represent the responses received from the peer node. `ConsumerId` is an integer that represents the ID of the consumer that is processing the state sync batch.

The `ToString()` method of the class returns a string that provides information about the state sync batch. It returns the number of state sync requests in the batch and the number of responses received.

Overall, the `StateSyncBatch` class is an important component of the FastSync module in the Nethermind project. It provides a way to represent a batch of state sync requests and the corresponding responses received from a peer node. This class can be used in conjunction with other classes and modules in the Nethermind project to synchronize the state of Ethereum nodes efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StateSyncBatch` class?
   - The `StateSyncBatch` class is used for state synchronization during fast sync in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute on the class?
   - The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute specifies how the object should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it shows the number of requested nodes, responses, and the assigned peer.

3. What is the purpose of the `ConsumerId` property?
   - The `ConsumerId` property is used to identify the consumer of the state sync batch. It is set by the consumer and can be used later to track the progress of the synchronization.
