This code defines an enumeration called `NodeDataType` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's `FastSync` module. The purpose of this enumeration is to provide a way to specify the type of data that should be synchronized between nodes during the fast synchronization process.

The `NodeDataType` enumeration is marked with the `[Flags]` attribute, which means that its values can be combined using bitwise OR operations. The enumeration has four possible values: `None`, `Code`, `State`, and `Storage`. These values represent different types of data that can be synchronized during fast synchronization.

The `None` value is used to indicate that no data should be synchronized. The `Code` value is used to indicate that code data should be synchronized. This includes the bytecode of smart contracts and other executable code on the blockchain. The `State` value is used to indicate that state data should be synchronized. This includes the current state of the blockchain, such as account balances and contract storage. The `Storage` value is used to indicate that storage data should be synchronized. This includes the storage of smart contracts on the blockchain.

The `All` value is a combination of the `Code`, `State`, and `Storage` values, and is used to indicate that all types of data should be synchronized.

This enumeration is likely used in other parts of the `FastSync` module to specify which types of data should be synchronized during the fast synchronization process. For example, a method that synchronizes code data might take a `NodeDataType` parameter with a value of `Code`, while a method that synchronizes all types of data might take a `NodeDataType` parameter with a value of `All`.

Overall, this code provides a simple but important tool for specifying which types of data should be synchronized during fast synchronization in the `Nethermind` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines an enum called `NodeDataType` within the `Nethermind.Synchronization.FastSync` namespace.

2. What values can be assigned to the `NodeDataType` enum?
   - The `NodeDataType` enum has four possible values: `None`, `Code`, `State`, `Storage`, and `All`. These values are assigned integer values of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 respectively.

3. What is the significance of the `[Flags]` attribute applied to the `NodeDataType` enum?
   - The `[Flags]` attribute indicates that the values of the `NodeDataType` enum can be combined using bitwise OR operations. This allows for more flexible usage of the enum in code.
