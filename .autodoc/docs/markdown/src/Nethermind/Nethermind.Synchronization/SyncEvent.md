This code defines an enumeration called `SyncEvent` within the `Nethermind.Synchronization` namespace. The `SyncEvent` enumeration contains four possible values: `Started`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, and `Completed`. 

This enumeration is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to track the status of synchronization events. For example, when a node begins synchronizing with the network, it may emit a `SyncEvent.Started` event. If the synchronization fails, it may emit a `SyncEvent.Failed` event. If the user cancels the synchronization, it may emit a `SyncEvent.Cancelled` event. Finally, when the synchronization is complete, it may emit a `SyncEvent.Completed` event. 

By using this enumeration, the Nethermind project can ensure that all synchronization events are consistently tracked and handled in a standardized way. Other parts of the project can subscribe to these events and take appropriate actions based on the event type. 

Here is an example of how this enumeration might be used in code:

```
using Nethermind.Synchronization;

public class SyncManager
{
    public event EventHandler<SyncEvent> SyncEventOccurred;

    public void StartSync()
    {
        // Perform synchronization logic
        SyncEventOccurred?.Invoke(this, SyncEvent.Completed);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SyncManager` class has an event called `SyncEventOccurred` that other parts of the project can subscribe to. When the `StartSync` method is called, the synchronization logic is performed and a `SyncEvent.Completed` event is emitted. This event is then passed to any subscribers of the `SyncEventOccurred` event.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?** 
A smart developer might wonder what this code file is responsible for within the Nethermind project, as it only contains an enum definition. 

2. **What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?** 
A smart developer might ask about the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file, which indicates the license under which the code is released. 

3. **How is the SyncEvent enum used within the Nethermind project?** 
A smart developer might be curious about how the SyncEvent enum is utilized within the Nethermind project, and where it is referenced in the codebase.
