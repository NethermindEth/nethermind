The `TotalDifficultyBetterPeerStrategy` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to determine the best peer to synchronize with. This class implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface, which defines methods for comparing peers and determining if a peer is desired.

The `TotalDifficultyBetterPeerStrategy` class takes in an `ILogManager` object in its constructor, which is used to create a logger object. This logger object is used to log messages when a desired peer is found.

The `Compare` method takes in two tuples of type `(UInt256 TotalDifficulty, long Number)` and compares their `TotalDifficulty` values. It returns an integer value that indicates whether the first tuple's `TotalDifficulty` is greater than, equal to, or less than the second tuple's `TotalDifficulty`.

The `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method takes in two tuples of type `(UInt256 TotalDifficulty, long Number)` and uses the `Compare` method to determine if the first tuple is better than the second tuple. It returns a boolean value that indicates whether the first tuple is better than the second tuple.

The `IsDesiredPeer` method takes in two tuples of type `(UInt256 TotalDifficulty, long Number)` and determines if the first tuple is a desired peer. It first checks if the first tuple is better than the second tuple using the `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method. If the first tuple is not better than the second tuple, it checks if the `TotalDifficulty` values of the two tuples are equal and if the `Number` value of the first tuple is greater than the `Number` value of the second tuple. If either of these conditions is true, the method returns `true`, indicating that the first tuple is a desired peer. If a desired peer is found, a log message is written using the logger object.

Overall, the `TotalDifficultyBetterPeerStrategy` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's synchronization process. It provides a way to compare peers and determine the best peer to synchronize with. The `Compare` and `IsBetterThanLocalChain` methods are used to compare peers, while the `IsDesiredPeer` method is used to determine if a peer is desired. The logger object is used to log messages when a desired peer is found.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a class called `TotalDifficultyBetterPeerStrategy` which implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. Its purpose is to provide a strategy for selecting better peers based on their total difficulty.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code file depends on two external namespaces: `Nethermind.Int256` and `Nethermind.Logging`. It also requires an instance of `ILogManager` to be passed to its constructor.

3. What is the logic behind the `IsDesiredPeer` method?
- The `IsDesiredPeer` method checks whether a given peer is desired based on its total difficulty and block number compared to the local chain's best header. If the peer has a higher total difficulty or the same total difficulty but a higher block number, it is considered a desired peer. The method also logs a message if the desired peer is better than the local chain.
