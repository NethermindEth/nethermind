The `SyncReport` class is responsible for generating synchronization reports for the Nethermind blockchain node. It provides a high-level overview of the synchronization process, including the progress of downloading headers, bodies, and receipts, as well as the number of peers connected to the node.

The class implements the `ISyncReport` interface and contains several properties that track the progress of the synchronization process, such as `HeadersInQueue`, `BodiesInQueue`, `ReceiptsInQueue`, `FastBlocksHeaders`, `FastBlocksBodies`, `FastBlocksReceipts`, `FullSyncBlocksDownloaded`, and `BeaconHeaders`. These properties are updated periodically by a timer that is created in the constructor of the class.

The `SyncReport` class also contains several private methods that are responsible for writing different types of synchronization reports, such as `WriteSyncReport`, `WriteStateNodesReport`, `WriteDbSyncReport`, `WriteNotStartedReport`, `WriteFastBlocksReport`, `WriteFullSyncReport`, and `WriteBeaconSyncReport`. These methods are called by the timer when it elapses.

The `SyncReport` class takes several dependencies in its constructor, such as `ISyncPeerPool`, `INodeStatsManager`, `ISyncModeSelector`, `ISyncConfig`, `IPivot`, `ILogManager`, `ITimerFactory`, and `double`. These dependencies are used to configure the synchronization process and to log synchronization events.

Overall, the `SyncReport` class provides a useful tool for monitoring the synchronization process of the Nethermind blockchain node and can be used to diagnose synchronization issues and optimize synchronization performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncReport` class?
- The `SyncReport` class is responsible for generating and writing synchronization reports for the Nethermind project.

2. What are the different synchronization modes supported by this code?
- The different synchronization modes supported by this code include `Full`, `FastSync`, `FastHeaders`, `FastBodies`, `FastReceipts`, `StateNodes`, and `BeaconHeaders`.

3. What is the role of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface in this code?
- The `ISyncModeSelector` interface is used to select the current synchronization mode and trigger events when the synchronization mode changes.
