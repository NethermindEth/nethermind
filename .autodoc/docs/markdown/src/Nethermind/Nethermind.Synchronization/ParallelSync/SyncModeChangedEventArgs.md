[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Synchronization/ParallelSync/SyncModeChangedEventArgs.cs)

This code defines a C# class called `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. The purpose of this class is to provide an event argument that can be used to notify subscribers when the synchronization mode of the Nethermind node changes.

The `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class has two properties: `Previous` and `Current`, both of which are of type `SyncMode`. The `Previous` property represents the synchronization mode before the change, while the `Current` property represents the synchronization mode after the change.

The `SyncMode` type is defined in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace and represents the different synchronization modes that the Nethermind node can be in. These modes include `Fast`, `Full`, and `Light`.

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way for other parts of the code to be notified when the synchronization mode changes. For example, if a user wants to be notified when the node switches from `Fast` to `Full` synchronization mode, they can subscribe to this event and take appropriate action when it is raised.

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```
using Nethermind.Synchronization.ParallelSync;

public class SyncModeChangeNotifier
{
    public event EventHandler<SyncModeChangedEventArgs> SyncModeChanged;

    private SyncMode _currentSyncMode;

    public SyncMode CurrentSyncMode
    {
        get => _currentSyncMode;
        set
        {
            if (_currentSyncMode != value)
            {
                var args = new SyncModeChangedEventArgs(_currentSyncMode, value);
                _currentSyncMode = value;
                SyncModeChanged?.Invoke(this, args);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a class called `SyncModeChangeNotifier` that has an event called `SyncModeChanged` that uses the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class as its event argument. We also define a property called `CurrentSyncMode` that represents the current synchronization mode of the node.

When the `CurrentSyncMode` property is set to a new value, we create a new instance of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class with the previous and current synchronization modes, and then raise the `SyncModeChanged` event with this argument. This allows any subscribers to the event to be notified of the synchronization mode change and take appropriate action.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class?
   - The `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class is used to represent an event argument that contains information about a change in synchronization mode.

2. What is the significance of the `SyncMode` enum?
   - The `SyncMode` enum is likely an enumeration of different synchronization modes that can be used in the Nethermind project.

3. What is the relationship between this file and the rest of the Nethermind project?
   - It is unclear from this file alone what the relationship is between this file and the rest of the Nethermind project. Further context would be needed to determine this.
