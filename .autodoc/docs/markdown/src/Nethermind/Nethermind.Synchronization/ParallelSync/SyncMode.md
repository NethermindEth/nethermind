This code defines an enum called `SyncMode` and an extension method for it. The `SyncMode` enum is used to represent the different synchronization modes that can be used in the Nethermind project. Each mode is represented by a flag value that can be combined with other flags using bitwise OR operations. The different synchronization modes are:

- `None`: No synchronization mode is active.
- `WaitingForBlock`: The node is connected to other nodes and is processing based on discovery.
- `Disconnected`: The node is not connected to any other nodes.
- `FastBlocks`: This is a stage of fast sync that downloads headers, bodies, or receipts from pivot to the beginning of the chain in parallel.
- `FastSync`: This is a standard fast sync mode before the peers head - 32 (threshold). It happens after the fast blocks finish downloading from pivot downwards. By default, the pivot for fast blocks is 0 so the fast blocks finish immediately.
- `StateNodes`: This is the stage of the fast sync when all the trie nodes are downloaded. The node can keep switching between `StateNodes` and `FastSync` while it has to catch up with the Head - 32 due to peers not returning old trie nodes.
- `Full`: This is either a standard full archive sync from genesis or full sync after `StateNodes` finish.
- `DbLoad`: Loading previously downloaded blocks from the DB.
- `FastHeaders`: This is a stage of fast sync that downloads headers in parallel.
- `FastBodies`: This is a stage of fast sync that downloads bodies in parallel.
- `FastReceipts`: This is a stage of fast sync that downloads receipts in parallel.
- `SnapSync`: This is a stage of snap sync that state is being downloaded (accounts, storages, code, proofs).
- `BeaconHeaders`: Reverse download of headers from beacon pivot to genesis.

The `All` flag is a combination of all the other flags.

The `SyncModeExtensions` class defines an extension method called `NotSyncing` that returns `true` if the `SyncMode` is either `WaitingForBlock` or `Disconnected`. This method can be used to check if the node is currently syncing or not.

This code is important for the Nethermind project because it defines the different synchronization modes that can be used to synchronize the node with the Ethereum network. These modes are used throughout the project to determine how the node should behave in different situations. For example, the `FastSync` mode is used when the node needs to catch up quickly with the network, while the `Full` mode is used when the node needs to download the entire blockchain from the beginning. The `SyncModeExtensions` class provides a convenient way to check if the node is currently syncing or not.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncMode` enum?
    
    The `SyncMode` enum is used to represent different synchronization modes for a blockchain node, including waiting for blocks, fast sync, full sync, and snap sync.

2. What is the `NotSyncing` extension method used for?
    
    The `NotSyncing` extension method is used to check if the current `SyncMode` is either `WaitingForBlock` or `Disconnected`, indicating that the node is not currently syncing with the network.

3. What is the difference between `FastHeaders`, `FastBodies`, and `FastReceipts`?
    
    `FastHeaders`, `FastBodies`, and `FastReceipts` are all stages of the fast sync process, but they download different types of data in parallel. `FastHeaders` downloads block headers, `FastBodies` downloads block bodies, and `FastReceipts` downloads transaction receipts.
