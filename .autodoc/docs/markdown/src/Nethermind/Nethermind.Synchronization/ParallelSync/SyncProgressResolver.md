The `SyncProgressResolver` class is responsible for resolving the synchronization progress of the Nethermind blockchain. It implements the `ISyncProgressResolver` interface and provides methods to find the best full state, best header, best full block, best processed block, chain difficulty, and total difficulty of a block. It also provides methods to check if the blocks, bodies, and receipts are finished downloading during fast sync, and if the snapshot get ranges are finished.

The `SyncProgressResolver` class takes in several dependencies, including `IBlockTree`, `IReceiptStorage`, `IDb`, `ITrieNodeResolver`, `ProgressTracker`, `ISyncConfig`, and `ILogManager`. These dependencies are used to resolve the synchronization progress of the blockchain.

The `FindBestFullState` method searches for the best full state of the blockchain. It first searches for the full state in the head block, and if not found, it searches for the full state in the best suggested header. It returns the best full state found.

The `SearchForFullState` method searches for the full state of a block starting from the given block header. It searches for the full state up to a maximum of 128 blocks back. It returns the block number of the best full state found.

The `FindBestHeader` method returns the block number of the best suggested header.

The `FindBestFullBlock` method returns the block number of the best full block. It returns the minimum of the best suggested header and the best suggested body.

The `IsLoadingBlocksFromDb` method returns a boolean indicating whether the block tree is currently loading blocks from the database.

The `FindBestProcessedBlock` method returns the block number of the best processed block. It returns the block number of the head block.

The `ChainDifficulty` property returns the total difficulty of the best suggested body.

The `GetTotalDifficulty` method returns the total difficulty of a block given its hash. It first checks if the block hash matches the best suggested header hash or parent hash. If it does, it returns the total difficulty of the best suggested header. If not, it searches for the block header with the given hash and returns its total difficulty.

The `IsFastBlocksHeadersFinished`, `IsFastBlocksBodiesFinished`, and `IsFastBlocksReceiptsFinished` methods check if the headers, bodies, and receipts are finished downloading during fast sync. They return a boolean indicating whether the download is finished.

The `IsSnapGetRangesFinished` method checks if the snapshot get ranges are finished. It returns a boolean indicating whether the snapshot get ranges are finished.

Overall, the `SyncProgressResolver` class provides methods to resolve the synchronization progress of the Nethermind blockchain. It is used in the larger project to track the progress of the blockchain synchronization and fast sync.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncProgressResolver` class?
- The `SyncProgressResolver` class is responsible for resolving the progress of the synchronization process by finding the best full state, best header, best full block, and best processed block, as well as determining if the synchronization is loading blocks from the database, and if fast blocks headers, bodies, and receipts are finished.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxLookupBack` constant?
- The `MaxLookupBack` constant is used to limit the number of blocks that the `SearchForFullState` method will look back to find the best full state. It is set to 128.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsFullySynced` method?
- The `IsFullySynced` method checks whether a given state root is fully synced by checking if it is in memory or has been saved in the database. If it is fully synced, it returns true, otherwise, it returns false.
