The code defines a static class called Metrics that contains a set of properties that are decorated with custom attributes. These properties are used to track various metrics related to the synchronization process in the Nethermind project.

The GaugeMetric attribute is used to mark properties that represent a gauge metric, which is a metric that represents a value at a particular point in time. The CounterMetric attribute is used to mark properties that represent a counter metric, which is a metric that represents a count of events over time.

The properties in the Metrics class track various metrics related to the synchronization process, such as the number of headers, bodies, and receipts downloaded during the fast blocks stage, the amount of state synced in bytes, the number of requests sent for state node sync, the number of state trie nodes and storage trie nodes synced, the number of synced bytecodes, and the number of sync peers and priority peers.

These metrics can be used to monitor the performance of the synchronization process and to identify any issues or bottlenecks that may be affecting the process. For example, if the number of synced bytecodes is consistently low, it may indicate that there is an issue with the bytecode syncing process that needs to be addressed.

Here is an example of how one of these metrics can be accessed:

```
long syncedStateTrieNodes = Metrics.SyncedStateTrieNodes;
```

This code retrieves the value of the SyncedStateTrieNodes property, which represents the number of state trie nodes that have been synced. This value can then be used for monitoring and analysis purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Metrics` class?
    
    The `Metrics` class is a static class that contains various metrics related to synchronization in the Nethermind project.

2. What do the `GaugeMetric` and `CounterMetric` attributes do?
    
    The `GaugeMetric` and `CounterMetric` attributes are used to mark fields as metrics that should be tracked by the Nethermind monitoring system. `GaugeMetric` is used for values that can go up or down, while `CounterMetric` is used for values that only increase.

3. What is the difference between the `long` and `decimal` data types used in this code?
    
    The `long` data type is used for integer values, while the `decimal` data type is used for decimal values. In this code, `FastBodies`, `FastReceipts`, and various `long` metrics represent integer values, while `FastHeaders` is a `decimal` metric that represents a decimal value.
