The code provided is a C# program that runs benchmarks for the Nethermind project. The purpose of this program is to measure the performance of various components of the Nethermind project and provide a dashboard with the results. 

The program uses the BenchmarkDotNet library to run the benchmarks. The `DashboardConfig` class is a custom configuration for the benchmarks. It adds various column providers, loggers, exporters, and diagnosers to the benchmark configuration. The `Program` class is the entry point for the program. It defines two lists of assemblies that contain the benchmarks to be run. The first list, `additionalJobAssemblies`, contains benchmarks that require a longer run time and a specific runtime environment. The second list, `simpleJobAssemblies`, contains benchmarks that can be run with the default configuration. 

If the program is run in debug mode, all the benchmarks are run using the `DebugInProcessConfig` configuration. Otherwise, the program runs each benchmark assembly in the `additionalJobAssemblies` list with a `MediumRun` job and the `Core70` runtime environment. It runs each benchmark assembly in the `simpleJobAssemblies` list with the default configuration. 

Overall, this program is an important tool for the Nethermind project as it allows developers to measure the performance of various components and optimize them for better performance. The dashboard provides a clear view of the results and helps developers identify areas that need improvement. 

Example usage:

To run the benchmarks, navigate to the directory containing the `Program.cs` file and run the following command:

```
dotnet run
``` 

This will run all the benchmarks with the default configuration. To run the benchmarks in debug mode, use the following command:

```
dotnet run --configuration Debug
``` 

This will run all the benchmarks with the `DebugInProcessConfig` configuration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DashboardConfig` class?
- The `DashboardConfig` class is a custom configuration class for the BenchmarkDotNet library that specifies various settings for benchmarking jobs, such as column providers, loggers, exporters, and diagnosers.

2. What are the contents of the `additionalJobAssemblies` and `simpleJobAssemblies` lists?
- The `additionalJobAssemblies` list contains the assemblies for various benchmarking jobs related to JSON-RPC, EVM, network discovery, and precompiles, while the `simpleJobAssemblies` list contains the assembly for a benchmarking job related to Ethereum tests.

3. What is the purpose of the `if (Debugger.IsAttached)` block?
- The `if (Debugger.IsAttached)` block runs all benchmarking jobs in the current process if a debugger is attached, using the `DebugInProcessConfig` configuration. Otherwise, it runs each benchmarking job in a separate process using the `DashboardConfig` configuration.
