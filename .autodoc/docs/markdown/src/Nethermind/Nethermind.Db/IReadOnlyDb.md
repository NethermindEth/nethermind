This code defines an interface called `IReadOnlyDb` within the `Nethermind.Db` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide read-only access to a database, which is a key component of the Nethermind project. 

The `IReadOnlyDb` interface extends the `IDb` interface, which means that it inherits all of the methods and properties of `IDb`. However, it also adds a new method called `ClearTempChanges()`. This method is used to clear any temporary changes that have been made to the database since the last commit. 

In the context of the Nethermind project, the `IReadOnlyDb` interface is likely to be used by other components that need to read data from the database but do not need to modify it. For example, the blockchain component of Nethermind may use `IReadOnlyDb` to retrieve information about blocks and transactions. 

Here is an example of how `IReadOnlyDb` might be used in code:

```
using Nethermind.Db;

public class BlockchainReader
{
    private readonly IReadOnlyDb _db;

    public BlockchainReader(IReadOnlyDb db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public Block GetBlock(ulong blockNumber)
    {
        // Retrieve block data from the database
        byte[] blockData = _db.GetBlockData(blockNumber);

        // Deserialize block data into a Block object
        Block block = DeserializeBlock(blockData);

        return block;
    }
}
```

In this example, `BlockchainReader` is a class that reads data from the blockchain database. It takes an `IReadOnlyDb` object as a constructor parameter, which it uses to retrieve block data. The `GetBlock` method retrieves the data for a specific block number using the `GetBlockData` method provided by `IDb`, and then deserializes the data into a `Block` object. 

Overall, the `IReadOnlyDb` interface is a key component of the Nethermind project, providing read-only access to the database for other components to use. The `ClearTempChanges` method is a useful addition that allows temporary changes to be cleared when they are no longer needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IReadOnlyDb` interface?
   - The `IReadOnlyDb` interface extends the `IDb` interface and adds a method `ClearTempChanges()`, which is used to clear temporary changes made to the database.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the namespace `Nethermind.Db` used for?
   - The `Nethermind.Db` namespace is used for classes and interfaces related to database operations in the Nethermind project. The `IReadOnlyDb` interface is one such example.
