The `MemDb` class is a concrete implementation of the `IFullDb` and `IDbWithSpan` interfaces in the Nethermind project. It provides an in-memory key-value store that can be used to store and retrieve data. The purpose of this class is to provide a simple and fast database implementation that can be used for testing and development purposes.

The `MemDb` class uses a `SpanConcurrentDictionary` to store the key-value pairs. The `SpanConcurrentDictionary` is a thread-safe dictionary that uses `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` as keys and `byte[]` as values. This dictionary is used to store the data in memory.

The `MemDb` class provides methods to get, set, and remove key-value pairs. The `Get` method retrieves the value associated with a given key. The `Set` method sets the value associated with a given key. The `Remove` method removes the key-value pair associated with a given key. The `KeyExists` method checks if a given key exists in the database.

The `MemDb` class also provides methods to get all the keys and values in the database. The `GetAll` method returns all the key-value pairs in the database. The `GetAllValues` method returns all the values in the database. These methods can be used to iterate over all the key-value pairs in the database.

The `MemDb` class implements the `IDbWithSpan` interface, which provides methods to get and set values using `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` and `Span<byte>`. The `GetSpan` method returns a `Span<byte>` that points to the value associated with a given key. The `PutSpan` method sets the value associated with a given key using a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`.

The `MemDb` class also implements the `IFullDb` interface, which provides methods to start and commit batches of operations. The `StartBatch` method returns an `IBatch` object that can be used to group multiple operations into a single batch. The `Flush` method is a no-op in the `MemDb` class, as there is no need to flush data to disk.

Finally, the `MemDb` class provides properties to get the number of reads and writes performed on the database. These properties can be used to monitor the performance of the database.

Overall, the `MemDb` class provides a simple and fast in-memory key-value store that can be used for testing and development purposes. It is thread-safe and provides methods to get, set, and remove key-value pairs, as well as methods to iterate over all the key-value pairs in the database. It also provides methods to get and set values using `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` and `Span<byte>`, and methods to start and commit batches of operations.
## Questions:
