The `FullPruningDb` class is a database facade that allows full pruning. It is used to start pruning in a thread-safe way and duplicates all writes to the current database as well as the new one for full pruning, including write batches. It uses `IRocksDbFactory` to create new pruning databases. The `FullPruningInnerDbFactory` class is used to organize inner sub-databases.

The `FullPruningDb` class implements the `IDb`, `IFullPruningDb`, and `ITunableDb` interfaces. It has a constructor that takes `RocksDbSettings`, `IRocksDbFactory`, and an optional `Action` parameter. The `RocksDbSettings` parameter is used to configure the database, while the `IRocksDbFactory` parameter is used to create new databases. The optional `Action` parameter is used to update duplicate write metrics.

The `FullPruningDb` class has two private fields: `_currentDb` and `_pruningContext`. `_currentDb` is the current main database, which will be written to and will be the main source for reading. `_pruningContext` is the current pruning context, which is the secondary database that the state will be written to, as well as the state trie will be copied to. This will be null if no full pruning is in progress.

The `FullPruningDb` class has several methods that are used to read and write data to the database. The `this` indexer is used to get or set the value of a key. The `Get` method is used to get the value of a key with optional read flags. The `StartBatch` method is used to start a new batch. The `Remove` method is used to remove a key from the database. The `KeyExists` method is used to check if a key exists in the database. The `Flush` method is used to flush the database. The `Clear` method is used to clear the database.

The `FullPruningDb` class has two events: `PruningStarted` and `PruningFinished`. The `PruningStarted` event is raised when pruning is started. The `PruningFinished` event is raised when pruning is finished.

The `FullPruningDb` class has two inner classes: `PruningContext` and `DuplicatingBatch`. The `PruningContext` class is used to create a new pruning context with a new sub-database and try setting it as current. The `DuplicatingBatch` class is used to duplicate writes to the current database and the cloned database batches.

Overall, the `FullPruningDb` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it provides a way to start pruning in a thread-safe way and duplicates all writes to the current database as well as the new one for full pruning.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of a database facade that allows full pruning.

2. How does this code handle multithreaded access?
- The code uses Interlocked.CompareExchange to ensure that only one pruning context can be active at a time, and uses thread-safe data structures to handle concurrent access to batches.

3. What is the role of the IRocksDbFactory interface in this code?
- The IRocksDbFactory interface is used to create new pruning DBs, and the FullPruningInnerDbFactory class is used to organize inner sub-DBs.
