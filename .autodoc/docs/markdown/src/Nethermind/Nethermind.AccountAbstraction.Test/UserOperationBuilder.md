The `UserOperationBuilder` class is a builder for creating instances of the `UserOperation` class. The `UserOperation` class represents a user operation that can be executed on the Ethereum network. The `UserOperationBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `UserOperation` class for testing purposes.

The `UserOperationBuilder` class has a constructor that creates an instance of the `UserOperation` class with default values for all of its properties. The `With` methods can be used to set the values of the properties of the `UserOperation` instance being built. The `SignedAndResolved` method is used to sign the `UserOperation` instance being built with a private key and resolve it.

The `UserOperation` class is used in the Nethermind project to represent user operations that can be executed on the Ethereum network. The `UserOperation` class is used in conjunction with the `AccountAbstractionRpcModule` class to execute user operations on the Ethereum network. The `AccountAbstractionRpcModule` class is responsible for abstracting away the details of the Ethereum network and providing a simple interface for executing user operations.

Here is an example of how the `UserOperationBuilder` class can be used to create an instance of the `UserOperation` class:

```
UserOperation userOperation = new UserOperationBuilder()
    .WithSender(senderAddress)
    .WithNonce(nonce)
    .WithPaymaster(paymasterAddress)
    .WithCallData(callData)
    .WithInitCode(initCode)
    .WithPaymasterData(paymasterData)
    .WithMaxFeePerGas(maxFeePerGas)
    .WithMaxPriorityFeePerGas(maxPriorityFeePerGas)
    .WithCallGas(callGas)
    .WithVerificationGas(verificationGas)
    .WithPreVerificationGas(preVerificationGas)
    .SignedAndResolved(privateKey, entryPointAddress, chainId)
    .Build();
```

This code creates an instance of the `UserOperation` class with the specified values for its properties and signs it with the specified private key, entry point address, and chain ID. The resulting `UserOperation` instance can then be used to execute a user operation on the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UserOperationBuilder` class?
    
    The `UserOperationBuilder` class is used to build instances of the `UserOperation` class, which represents a user operation in the Nethermind system. It provides methods for setting various properties of the `UserOperation` object, such as the sender, nonce, paymaster, call data, and gas limits.

2. What is the `SignedAndResolved` method used for?
    
    The `SignedAndResolved` method is used to sign a `UserOperation` object with a private key and construct a request ID. It takes optional parameters for the private key, entry point address, and chain ID. This method is typically called after setting all the desired properties of the `UserOperation` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Core.Eip2930` namespace?
    
    The `Nethermind.Core.Eip2930` namespace contains classes and interfaces related to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 2930, which defines a new transaction type that supports multiple signatures and access lists. This namespace is likely used by the `UserOperation` class to implement the new transaction type.
