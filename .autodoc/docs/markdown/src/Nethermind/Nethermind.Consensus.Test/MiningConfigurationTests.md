The `MiningConfigurationTests` class is a test suite for the `MigrateConfigs` class, which is responsible for migrating configuration values between `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig` objects. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the migration process works as expected and that the configuration values are correctly updated.

The first test case, `mining_configuration_updates_with_blocks_config_values`, creates an instance of `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig` and sets the `ExtraData` property of `BlocksConfig` to a test value. The `MigrateConfigs.MigrateBlocksConfig` method is then called to migrate the `BlocksConfig` values to the `MiningConfig` object. Finally, an assertion is made to ensure that the `ExtraData` property of `MiningConfig.BlocksConfig` is equal to the test value. This test case ensures that the migration process works correctly when migrating values from `BlocksConfig` to `MiningConfig`.

The second test case, `blocks_configuration_updates_with_mining_config_values`, is similar to the first test case, but it sets the `ExtraData` property of `MiningConfig` instead of `BlocksConfig`. This test case ensures that the migration process works correctly when migrating values from `MiningConfig` to `BlocksConfig`.

The third test case, `If_blocks_configuration_conflicts_with_mining_config_values_throw`, tests that an exception is thrown when there is a conflict between the `ExtraData` property of `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig`. This test case ensures that the migration process correctly handles conflicts between the two configuration objects.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the `MigrateConfigs` class correctly migrates configuration values between `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig` objects. This is important for the larger Nethermind project because it ensures that the configuration values are correctly set and updated, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MigrateConfigs` class and its `MigrateBlocksConfig` method?
- The `MigrateConfigs` class and its `MigrateBlocksConfig` method are used to migrate blocks configuration values to mining configuration values and vice versa.

2. What is the significance of the `ExtraData` property in `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig`?
- The `ExtraData` property in `BlocksConfig` and `MiningConfig` is used to store additional data that can be included in blocks during mining.

3. What is the purpose of the `InvalidConfigurationException` exception and when is it thrown?
- The `InvalidConfigurationException` exception is thrown when there is a conflict between the blocks configuration values and mining configuration values, specifically when the `ExtraData` property is set to different values in both configurations.
