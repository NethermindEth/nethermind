The `EnrTreeRoot` class is a representation of the root node of a tree structure used in the Domain Name System (DNS) for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) records. The ENS is a decentralized naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that maps human-readable domain names to machine-readable identifiers, such as Ethereum addresses. The tree structure is used to store and organize ENS records in a hierarchical manner.

The `EnrTreeRoot` class inherits from the `EnrTreeNode` class and defines four properties: `EnrRoot`, `LinkRoot`, `Sequence`, and `Signature`. The `EnrRoot` and `LinkRoot` properties are strings that represent the root hashes of subtrees containing nodes and links subtrees, respectively. The `Sequence` property is an integer that is updated each time the tree gets updated. The `Signature` property is a string that represents the signature of the root node, but the public key from which the signature was generated is not specified.

The `ToString()` method is overridden to return a string representation of the root node in the format `enrtree-root:v1 e=[enr-root] l=[link-root] seq=[sequence-number] sig=[signature]`. The `Refs` property is overridden to return an array of strings containing the `EnrRoot` and `LinkRoot` properties. The `Links` and `Records` properties are overridden to return empty arrays of strings.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to implement the ENS functionality. The `EnrTreeRoot` class represents the root node of the tree structure used to store and organize ENS records. Other classes in the `Nethermind.Network.Dns` namespace are used to define the nodes and links of the tree structure and to perform operations on the tree, such as adding and removing nodes. The `EnrTreeRoot` class is a fundamental component of the ENS implementation in Nethermind and is used to maintain the integrity and consistency of the ENS records.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EnrTreeRoot class?
    
    The EnrTreeRoot class is a subclass of EnrTreeNode and represents the root of a tree structure used in DNS. It contains information about the root hashes of subtrees, a sequence number, and a signature.

2. What is the format of the TXT record that represents the root of the tree?
    
    The TXT record representing the root of the tree has the following format: "enrtree-root:v1 e=[enr-root] l=[link-root] seq=[sequence-number] sig=[signature]".

3. What is the purpose of the Refs, Links, and Records properties in the EnrTreeRoot class?
    
    The Refs property returns an array of the root hashes of subtrees containing nodes and links subtrees. The Links and Records properties return empty arrays, indicating that the root node does not have any child nodes or records.
