The `EnrTreeCrawler` class is responsible for crawling a tree of Ethereum Name Records (ENRs) and returning the records found. ENRs are a type of DNS record used in Ethereum to store metadata about nodes on the network. The `SearchTree` method takes a domain name as input and returns an asynchronous enumerable of strings representing the ENRs found in the tree. 

If the domain name starts with "enrtree://", the method extracts the domain name and a public key from the input string. The public key is used to verify the authenticity of the ENR tree, but this implementation does not perform any verification. The `SearchTree` method then creates a new `DnsClient` object with the extracted domain name and a new `SearchContext` object with an empty string as the starting reference. It then calls the private `SearchTree` method with these objects and returns the result.

The `SearchTree` method calls the private `SearchTree` method with a `DnsClient` object and a `SearchContext` object. The `SearchTree` method returns an asynchronous enumerable of strings representing the ENRs found in the tree. The `SearchTree` method uses a `while` loop to iterate over the references to visit in the `SearchContext` object. For each reference, it calls the private `SearchNode` method with the `DnsClient` object, the reference, and the `SearchContext` object. It then yields each node record text returned by the `SearchNode` method.

The `SearchNode` method takes a `DnsClient` object, a query string, and a `SearchContext` object as input and returns an asynchronous enumerable of strings representing the ENRs found in the node. The method first checks if the query has already been visited by checking the `VisitedRefs` property of the `SearchContext` object. If the query has not been visited, the method adds it to the `VisitedRefs` property and calls the `Lookup` method of the `DnsClient` object with the query. The `Lookup` method returns an enumerable of strings representing the nodes in the tree. For each node, the method parses the node using the `EnrTreeParser` class and yields each node record text and each reference in the node. The method then adds each reference to the `RefsToVisit` property of the `SearchContext` object.

The `SearchContext` class is a private class used to store the state of the search. It has a `VisitedRefs` property that stores the references that have already been visited and a `RefsToVisit` property that stores the references that need to be visited.

Overall, the `EnrTreeCrawler` class provides a way to crawl a tree of Ethereum Name Records and return the records found. This functionality can be used in the larger project to discover and verify nodes on the Ethereum network. For example, it could be used to find nodes that support a particular protocol or to verify that a node is authorized to participate in the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EnrTreeCrawler` class?
    
    The `EnrTreeCrawler` class is used to crawl a DNS-based Ethereum Name Service (ENS) tree and return a list of node records.

2. What is the significance of the `enrtree://` prefix in the `SearchTree` method?
    
    The `enrtree://` prefix is used to indicate that the domain being searched is a DNS-based ENS tree. The method then extracts the domain name and public key of the ENS tree signer, if available.

3. What is the purpose of the `SearchContext` class?
    
    The `SearchContext` class is used to keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the search process and the nodes that still need to be visited. It is used to prevent the crawler from visiting the same node multiple times.
