The `EnrTreeParser` class is responsible for parsing different types of nodes in an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Resource Record (RR) tree. The ENS is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain that maps human-readable domain names to machine-readable identifiers, such as Ethereum addresses. The ENS RR tree is a Merkle tree data structure that stores ENS records in a hierarchical manner. Each node in the tree can be either a leaf node, a branch node, or the root node.

The `EnrTreeParser` class provides a set of static methods that can parse different types of nodes in the ENS RR tree. The `ParseNode` method takes a string representation of an ENS node and returns an instance of the corresponding `EnrTreeNode` subclass. The `EnrTreeNode` is an abstract base class that defines the common properties and methods of all ENS nodes.

The `EnrTreeParser` class defines four private methods that parse different types of ENS nodes. The `ParseEnrLinkedTree` method parses a linked tree node, which is a node that contains a link to another ENS RR tree. The `ParseEnrLeaf` method parses a leaf node, which is a node that contains an ENS record. The `ParseBranch` method parses a branch node, which is a node that contains a list of hashes that point to child nodes. The `ParseEnrRoot` method parses the root node, which is a node that contains metadata about the ENS RR tree, such as the root hash, the link hash, the sequence number, and the signature.

The `EnrTreeParser` class also defines some constants that are used by the parsing methods. The `HashLengthBase32` constant defines the length of a hash in base32 encoding. The `SigLengthBase32` constant defines the length of a signature in base32 encoding. The `HashesIndex` constant defines the index of the first hash in a branch node string representation.

Overall, the `EnrTreeParser` class is an essential component of the Nethermind project's ENS implementation. It provides a convenient way to parse different types of nodes in the ENS RR tree and extract the relevant information from them. This information can then be used to resolve ENS names to Ethereum addresses and other identifiers. Here is an example of how to use the `EnrTreeParser` class to parse an ENS node:

```csharp
string enrNodeText = "enr:...";
EnrTreeNode enrNode = EnrTreeParser.ParseNode(enrNodeText);
if (enrNode is EnrLeaf leaf)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Node record: {leaf.NodeRecord}");
}
else if (enrNode is EnrTreeBranch branch)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hashes: {string.Join(",", branch.Hashes)}");
}
else if (enrNode is EnrTreeRoot root)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"ENR root: {root.EnrRoot}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Link root: {root.LinkRoot}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Sequence: {root.Sequence}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Signature: {root.Signature}");
}
else if (enrNode is EnrLinkedTree linkedTree)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Link: {linkedTree.Link}");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EnrTreeParser` class?
    
    The `EnrTreeParser` class is a static class that provides methods for parsing different types of ENR tree nodes.

2. What is an ENR tree and how is it represented in this code?
    
    An ENR tree is a tree structure used in Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to store and manage Ethereum Name Records (ENRs). In this code, an ENR tree is represented as a collection of different types of nodes, including leaf nodes, branch nodes, and root nodes.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by the `ParseNode` method and why?
    
    The `ParseNode` method can throw a `NotSupportedException` if the input string does not match any of the supported ENR tree node types. This is because the method is designed to only handle specific types of nodes and cannot parse other types of nodes.
