This code is a test file for the Nethermind project's Overseer module. The purpose of this file is to test the basic functionality of the module by starting a Clique node, waiting for 3 seconds, and then killing the node. The test is run using the NUnit testing framework.

The code begins with SPDX license information and imports the necessary modules for testing. The `BasicTests` class is defined as a subclass of `TestBuilder` and is marked as `[Explicit]`, meaning that it will not be run automatically with other tests. 

The `Setup` method is defined but does not contain any code. The `Test1` method is defined as an asynchronous task that starts a Clique node with the name "basicnode1" using the `StartCliqueNode` method from the `TestBuilder` class. The `Wait` method is then called with a delay of 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) to allow the node to start up. Finally, the `Kill` method is called to stop the node. The `ScenarioCompletion` property is then awaited to ensure that the test completes before moving on to the next test.

This code is an important part of the Nethermind project as it ensures that the basic functionality of the Overseer module is working as expected. By testing the ability to start and stop a Clique node, the module can be verified to be working correctly. This test can be run manually or as part of a larger suite of automated tests to ensure that the module is functioning correctly. 

Example usage of this code in a larger project would involve running this test alongside other tests for the Overseer module to ensure that all functionality is working as expected. This would be done as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that any changes to the module do not break existing functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Overseer.Test.Framework` namespace?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet what the purpose of the `Nethermind.Overseer.Test.Framework` namespace is. A smart developer might want to investigate further to understand its role in the project.

2. Why is the `BasicTests` class marked with the `[Explicit]` attribute?
   - The `[Explicit]` attribute is used to mark tests that should not be run by default. A smart developer might wonder why this particular test class is marked as explicit and whether there is a specific reason for it.

3. What is the purpose of the `ScenarioCompletion` variable?
   - The `ScenarioCompletion` variable is awaited at the end of the `Test1` method, but it is not clear from this code snippet what its purpose is. A smart developer might want to investigate further to understand its role in the test scenario.
