The code defines a class called `AuRaContext` that is used in the Nethermind project for testing purposes. The class inherits from a base class called `TestContextBase` and takes a generic type parameter `AuRaState`. The purpose of this class is to provide a context for testing the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind project.

The `AuRaContext` class has two public methods: `ReadBlockAuthors` and `ReadBlockNumber`. The `ReadBlockAuthors` method reads the block authors for each block in the current state of the `AuRaContext` object. The `ReadBlockNumber` method reads the current block number from the JSON-RPC API of the current node.

The `AuRaContext` class also has a private method called `ReadBlockAuthor` that is used by the `ReadBlockAuthors` method to read the block author for a specific block number. This method uses the JSON-RPC API of the current node to retrieve the block information and updates the state of the `AuRaContext` object with the block author information.

The `AuRaContext` class uses the `TestBuilder` class to get the current node's JSON-RPC client and make requests to the JSON-RPC API. The `AddJsonRpc` method is used to add JSON-RPC requests to the test context. This method takes a description of the request, the JSON-RPC method name, a lambda function that makes the request, and a lambda function that updates the state of the `AuRaContext` object with the result of the request.

Overall, the `AuRaContext` class provides a convenient way to test the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind project by providing a context for testing and making requests to the JSON-RPC API of the current node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuRaContext` class?
    
    The `AuRaContext` class is a subclass of `TestContextBase` and provides methods for reading block authors and block numbers using JSON-RPC.

2. What is the `AddJsonRpc` method used for?
    
    The `AddJsonRpc` method is used to add a JSON-RPC call to the test context, along with a state updater function that updates the `AuRaState` object with the result of the call.

3. What is the `AuRaState` object and what information does it contain?
    
    The `AuRaState` object is a state object used by the `AuRaContext` class to store information about the current state of the test. It contains a `BlocksCount` property that stores the number of blocks, and a `Blocks` dictionary that maps block numbers to tuples containing the miner address and step.
