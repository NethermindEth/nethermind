The `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for handling the exchange of capabilities between different components of the system. It implements the `IHandler` interface, which defines a method for handling a request and returning a response. In this case, the `Handle` method takes a collection of method names as input and returns a collection of capabilities that are supported by the system.

The `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` class has two dependencies injected into its constructor: an `IRpcCapabilitiesProvider` and an `ILogManager`. The `IRpcCapabilitiesProvider` is responsible for providing the capabilities of the system, while the `ILogManager` is used for logging.

The `Handle` method first retrieves the capabilities of the system from the `IRpcCapabilitiesProvider` and then checks if the requested methods are supported by the system. If a requested method is not found and the corresponding capability is activated, a warning message is logged using the `ILogManager`.

The `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate the exchange of capabilities between different components of the system. For example, it may be used by the consensus engine to check if a client has the necessary capabilities to participate in the consensus process. 

Here is an example of how the `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` class may be used:

```csharp
var capabilitiesProvider = new RpcCapabilitiesProvider();
var specProvider = new SpecProvider();
var logManager = new LogManager();

var handler = new ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler(capabilitiesProvider, specProvider, logManager);

var methods = new List<string> { "eth_getBlockByNumber", "eth_getTransactionByHash" };

var result = handler.Handle(methods);

foreach (var capability in result.Value)
{
    Console.WriteLine(capability);
}
``` 

In this example, a new instance of the `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` class is created with the necessary dependencies injected into its constructor. A list of method names is then passed to the `Handle` method, which returns a collection of capabilities that are supported by the system. Finally, the capabilities are printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `ExchangeCapabilitiesHandler` that implements the `IHandler` interface and handles the exchange of capabilities between two parties.
2. What other classes or interfaces does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on the `IRpcCapabilitiesProvider`, `ISpecProvider`, `ILogManager`, `IHandler`, and `ResultWrapper` interfaces, as well as the `ILogger` and `KeyValuePair` classes.
3. What is the expected input and output of the `Handle` method?
   - The `Handle` method expects an `IEnumerable<string>` of methods and returns a `ResultWrapper<IEnumerable<string>>` containing the keys of the capabilities dictionary.
