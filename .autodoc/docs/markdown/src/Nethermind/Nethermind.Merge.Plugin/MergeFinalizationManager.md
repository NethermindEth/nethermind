The `MergeFinalizationManager` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for managing the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. It implements two interfaces: `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` and `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager`. 

The `MergeFinalizationManager` constructor takes three parameters: `manualBlockFinalizationManager`, `blockFinalizationManager`, and `poSSwitcher`. The `manualBlockFinalizationManager` is an instance of `IManualBlockFinalizationManager`, which is responsible for managing the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. The `blockFinalizationManager` is an instance of `IBlockFinalizationManager`, which is responsible for managing the finalization of blocks in the blockchain using the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `poSSwitcher` is an instance of `IPoSSwitcher`, which is responsible for switching between validators in the blockchain.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has two private fields: `_manualBlockFinalizationManager` and `_auRaBlockFinalizationManager`. The `_manualBlockFinalizationManager` field is an instance of `IManualBlockFinalizationManager`, which is used to manage the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. The `_auRaBlockFinalizationManager` field is an instance of `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager`, which is used to manage the finalization of blocks in the blockchain using the AuRa consensus algorithm.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has two private methods: `OnSwitchHappened` and `OnBlockFinalized`. The `OnSwitchHappened` method is called when a switch happens between validators in the blockchain. The `OnBlockFinalized` method is called when a block is finalized in the blockchain.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has five public methods: `MarkFinalized`, `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy`, `GetFinalizationLevel`, `Dispose`, and two public properties: `LastFinalizedHash` and `LastFinalizedBlockLevel`. The `MarkFinalized` method is used to mark a block as finalized in the blockchain. The `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` method is used to get the last level finalized by a block hash. The `GetFinalizationLevel` method is used to get the finalization level of a block. The `Dispose` method is used to dispose of the `MergeFinalizationManager` instance. The `LastFinalizedHash` property is used to get the last finalized block hash. The `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` property is used to get the last finalized block level.

Overall, the `MergeFinalizationManager` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it manages the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. It provides an interface for managing the finalization of blocks using the AuRa consensus algorithm and can be used to switch between validators in the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the Nethermind project?
- This code defines a class called `MergeFinalizationManager` that implements two interfaces related to block finalization in the Nethermind blockchain. It is part of a plugin for the Nethermind client that enables merging of two chains and handles the finalization of blocks after the merge.

2. What is the significance of the `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface and how is it used in this code?
- The `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface is used to finalize blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm, which is used in the Nethermind blockchain. This code checks if an instance of this interface is available and uses it to finalize blocks if it exists.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsPostMerge` property and how is it used in this code?
- The `IsPostMerge` property is used to determine if the current state of the blockchain is after a merge has occurred. It is set to true if the `TerminalBlockReached` event has been triggered, indicating that the blockchain has reached a terminal block. This property is used to determine which block finalization manager to use when finalizing blocks.
