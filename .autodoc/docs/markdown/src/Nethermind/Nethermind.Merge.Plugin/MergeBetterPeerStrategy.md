The `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to implement a better peer selection strategy for the blockchain synchronization process. The class implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface, which defines the methods for comparing and selecting peers based on their total difficulty and block number.

The `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class takes four parameters in its constructor: `preMergeBetterPeerStrategy`, `poSSwitcher`, `beaconPivot`, and `logManager`. The `preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` parameter is an instance of the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface, which is used to compare peers before the merge process. The `poSSwitcher` parameter is an instance of the `IPoSSwitcher` interface, which is used to switch between different consensus protocols. The `beaconPivot` parameter is an instance of the `IBeaconPivot` interface, which is used to determine the pivot block for the beacon chain. The `logManager` parameter is an instance of the `ILogManager` interface, which is used to log messages.

The `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class implements three methods: `Compare`, `IsBetterThanLocalChain`, and `IsDesiredPeer`. The `Compare` method compares two peers based on their total difficulty and block number. If the total difficulty of both peers is less than the terminal total difficulty, the method calls the `Compare` method of the `preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` instance. Otherwise, it compares the block number of both peers.

The `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method determines whether a peer is better than the local chain based on their total difficulty and block number. If the total difficulty of both peers is less than the terminal total difficulty, the method calls the `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method of the `preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` instance. Otherwise, it compares the block number of both peers.

The `IsDesiredPeer` method determines whether a peer is a desired peer based on their total difficulty and block number. If the beacon pivot exists, the method returns true if the peer's block number is greater than or equal to the pivot number minus one. Otherwise, if the total difficulty of both peers is less than the terminal total difficulty, the method calls the `IsDesiredPeer` method of the `preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` instance. Otherwise, it returns false.

In summary, the `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class is used to implement a better peer selection strategy for the blockchain synchronization process. It compares and selects peers based on their total difficulty and block number, and it takes into account the terminal total difficulty and the beacon pivot block. The class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to improve the synchronization process and ensure the integrity of the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains a class called `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` which implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. It provides logic for selecting better peers during synchronization in the Nethermind project.

2. What other classes or interfaces does this code file depend on?
    
    This code file depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind` namespace, including `IBetterPeerStrategy`, `IPoSSwitcher`, `IBeaconPivot`, `ILogManager`, `UInt256`, and `ILogger`.

3. What is the role of the `ShouldApplyPreMergeLogic` method in this class?
    
    The `ShouldApplyPreMergeLogic` method is a private helper method that determines whether pre-merge or post-merge synchronization logic should be applied based on the total difficulty of two peers. It is used in several methods of the `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class to determine which logic to apply.
