The `ChainLevelHelper` class is part of the Nethermind project and is used to help with chain synchronization. It provides two methods, `GetNextHeaders` and `TrySetNextBlocks`, which are used to retrieve the next set of block headers and blocks respectively.

The `GetNextHeaders` method takes in a maximum count of headers to retrieve, a maximum header number, and an optional parameter to skip the last block count. It returns an array of block headers. The method first retrieves the starting point for the headers, which is the lowest beacon info where the forward beacon sync should start, or the latest block that was processed where we should continue processing. It then retrieves the headers by finding the `ChainLevelInfo` for the starting point and the `BlockInfo` for the `BeaconMainChainBlock`. It then finds the header for the `BeaconMainChainBlock` and adds it to the list of headers. If the `BeaconMainChainBlock` is a beacon info block, it sets the total difficulty of the header based on the previous header's total difficulty. Finally, it returns the array of headers.

The `TrySetNextBlocks` method takes in a maximum count of blocks to retrieve and a `BlockDownloadContext` object. It returns a boolean indicating whether the blocks were successfully retrieved. The method first checks if there are any blocks in the `BlockDownloadContext`. If there are none, it returns false. It then retrieves the `BlockInfo` for the `BeaconMainChainBlock` of the first block in the context. If the `BeaconMainChainBlock` is a beacon header and not a beacon body, it returns false. It then retrieves the hashes to request from the context and retrieves the blocks from the block tree. It sets the block body for each block in the context and returns true.

Overall, the `ChainLevelHelper` class is used to help with chain synchronization by retrieving the next set of block headers and blocks. It is used in the larger Nethermind project to help with blockchain synchronization.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IChainLevelHelper` interface?
- The `IChainLevelHelper` interface defines two methods for getting the next block headers and setting the next blocks, which are implemented by the `ChainLevelHelper` class.

2. What is the role of the `BeaconPivot` object in the `ChainLevelHelper` class?
- The `BeaconPivot` object is used to determine the starting point for syncing and to detect missing beacon headers. It is passed to the `ChainLevelHelper` constructor and stored as a private field.

3. What is the significance of the `TotalDifficulty` property in the `GetNextHeaders` method?
- The `TotalDifficulty` property is used to determine the total difficulty of a block, which is important for determining the validity of the block and its place in the blockchain. It is set based on the `TotalDifficulty` of the previous block and the `Difficulty` of the current block.
