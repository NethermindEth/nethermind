The `BeaconSync` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for synchronizing the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain with the Ethereum 1.0 chain. It implements the `IMergeSyncController` and `IBeaconSyncStrategy` interfaces. The `IMergeSyncController` interface defines methods for controlling the synchronization process, while the `IBeaconSyncStrategy` interface defines methods for synchronizing the beacon chain.

The `BeaconSync` class has a constructor that takes in several dependencies, including `IBeaconPivot`, `IBlockTree`, `ISyncConfig`, `IBlockCacheService`, and `ILogManager`. These dependencies are used to initialize the class and perform various synchronization tasks.

The `StopSyncing` method is used to stop the synchronization process. It removes the beacon pivot and clears the block cache service. The `InitBeaconHeaderSync` method is used to initialize the beacon header synchronization process. It ensures that the beacon pivot exists and sets the pivot block header. The `StopBeaconModeControl` method is used to stop the beacon mode control.

The `ShouldBeInBeaconHeaders` method checks whether the node should be in the beacon headers mode. It returns `true` if the beacon pivot exists, the node is not in the beacon mode control, and the beacon header synchronization is not finished.

The `ShouldBeInBeaconModeControl` method checks whether the node should be in the beacon mode control. It returns `true` if the node is in the beacon mode control.

The `IsBeaconSyncHeadersFinished` method checks whether the beacon header synchronization is finished. It returns `true` if the lowest inserted beacon header is null, the lowest inserted beacon header number is less than or equal to the pivot destination number, or the chain is merged.

The `IsBeaconSyncFinished` method checks whether the beacon synchronization is finished. It returns `true` if the beacon pivot does not exist or the block header is not null and was processed.

The `GetTargetBlockHeight` method returns the target block height for the synchronization process. It returns the process destination number if it exists, otherwise, it returns the pivot number.

Overall, the `BeaconSync` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's synchronization process. It provides methods for controlling the synchronization process and synchronizing the beacon chain with the Ethereum 1.0 chain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BeaconSync` class?
- The `BeaconSync` class is a synchronization strategy for merging two blockchains, and it implements the `IMergeSyncController` and `IBeaconSyncStrategy` interfaces.

2. What is the role of the `IBlockCacheService` interface in this code?
- The `IBlockCacheService` interface is used to clear the block cache service when `StopSyncing()` is called.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsBeaconSyncFinished()` method?
- The `IsBeaconSyncFinished()` method checks if the beacon sync is finished by verifying if the `blockHeader` is not null and if it was processed by the block tree.
