The code defines a class called `EngineRpcModule` that implements the `IEngineRpcModule` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface for the Nethermind project's engine. The class contains four public methods that can be called remotely:

1. `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`: This method takes a `ForkchoiceStateV1` object and an optional `PayloadAttributes` object as input and returns a `ForkchoiceUpdatedV1Result` object wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`. The method internally calls a private method called `ForkchoiceUpdated` with a version number of 2. The purpose of this method is to update the fork choice of the engine based on the input state.

2. `engine_getPayloadV2`: This method takes a byte array `payloadId` as input and returns a `GetPayloadV2Result` object wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`. The method internally calls a private method called `_getPayloadHandlerV2` to get the payload data. The purpose of this method is to retrieve the payload data for a given payload ID.

3. `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1`: This method takes a list of `Keccak` objects as input and returns a list of `ExecutionPayloadBodyV1Result` objects wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`. The method internally calls a private method called `_executionGetPayloadBodiesByHashV1Handler` to get the payload bodies for the given block hashes. The purpose of this method is to retrieve the payload bodies for a given list of block hashes.

4. `engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1`: This method takes two long integers `start` and `count` as input and returns a list of `ExecutionPayloadBodyV1Result` objects wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`. The method internally calls a private method called `_executionGetPayloadBodiesByRangeV1Handler` to get the payload bodies for the given range of blocks. The purpose of this method is to retrieve the payload bodies for a given range of blocks.

Overall, the `EngineRpcModule` class provides a convenient way to remotely access the engine's functionality through RPC calls. The class is part of the larger Nethermind project and is used to interact with the engine from other parts of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin` namespace?
- The `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin` namespace contains classes related to a merge plugin for the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?
- The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released, in this case, LGPL-3.0-only.

3. What is the difference between the `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1` and `engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1` methods?
- The `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1` method retrieves execution payload bodies for a list of block hashes, while the `engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1` method retrieves execution payload bodies for a range of blocks specified by start and count parameters.
