The `FilterBuilder` class is used to build a `LogFilter` object, which is used to filter logs from the Ethereum blockchain. The `LogFilter` object is used to retrieve logs from the blockchain that match certain criteria, such as a specific contract address or a specific event. 

The `FilterBuilder` class provides methods to set various filter parameters, such as the block range to search for logs, the contract address to filter by, and the event topics to filter by. The `FilterBuilder` class is designed to be used in unit tests to create `LogFilter` objects with specific filter criteria.

The `FilterBuilder` class has a private constructor and two public static factory methods: `New()` and `New(ref int currentFilterIndex)`. The `New()` method creates a new `FilterBuilder` object and sets the `_id` field to a unique value. The `New(ref int currentFilterIndex)` method creates a new `FilterBuilder` object and sets the `_id` field to the value of `currentFilterIndex`, which is then incremented. This allows multiple `FilterBuilder` objects to be created with unique IDs.

The `FilterBuilder` class provides methods to set the block range to search for logs, including `FromBlock()`, `ToBlock()`, and various convenience methods such as `FromEarliestBlock()` and `ToPendingBlock()`. The `FilterBuilder` class also provides methods to set the contract address to filter by, including `WithAddress()` and `WithAddresses()`. Finally, the `FilterBuilder` class provides a method to set the event topics to filter by, including `WithTopicExpressions()`.

Once the desired filter parameters have been set, the `Build()` method is called to create a new `LogFilter` object with the specified filter criteria. The `LogFilter` object can then be used to retrieve logs from the blockchain that match the specified criteria.

Example usage:

```
FilterBuilder.New()
    .FromBlock(1000)
    .ToBlock(2000)
    .WithAddress("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890")
    .WithTopicExpressions(
        new TopicExpression("Transfer(address,address,uint256)"),
        new TopicExpression(null, "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890")
    )
    .Build();
```

This example creates a new `LogFilter` object that filters logs from block 1000 to block 2000, for the contract address "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", and for the "Transfer" event with a specific sender address.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a `FilterBuilder` class that can be used to build a `LogFilter` object with various filter parameters.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - This comment specifies the license under which the code is released, which in this case is the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the purpose of the `WithTopicExpressions` method?
   - This method allows the developer to specify one or more `TopicExpression` objects to filter log events by their topics.
