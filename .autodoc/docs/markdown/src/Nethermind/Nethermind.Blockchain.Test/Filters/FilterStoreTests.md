The `FilterStoreTests` class is a test suite for the `FilterStore` class in the Nethermind project. The `FilterStore` class is responsible for creating, saving, and removing filters for the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `FilterStore` class is functioning correctly.

The test suite contains six test methods. The first two methods test the creation and saving of block and log filters, respectively. The `CreateBlockFilter` and `CreateLogFilter` methods are called to create new filters, which are then saved to the `FilterStore` using the `SaveFilter` method. The tests then check that the filters were saved correctly by calling the `FilterExists` and `GetFilterType` methods.

The third test method checks that the `FilterStore` class does not allow filters to be overwritten. An external filter is created and saved to the `FilterStore`, and then an attempt is made to save the same filter again. The test expects an `InvalidOperationException` to be thrown.

The fourth test method checks that the `FilterStore` class correctly increments filter IDs when storing externally created filters. An external filter is created and saved to the `FilterStore`, and then a new log filter is created and saved. The test checks that the filter IDs are correct and that the filter type is correct.

The fifth test method checks that the `FilterStore` class correctly removes filters and raises the `FilterRemoved` event. A block filter is created and saved to the `FilterStore`, and then the `RemoveFilter` method is called to remove the filter. The test checks that the filter was removed and that the `FilterRemoved` event was raised.

The sixth test method checks that the `FilterStore` class correctly creates address and topics filters. The test uses a `TestCaseSource` to provide different test cases for creating address and topics filters. The `CreateLogFilter` method is called with different parameters to create filters with different address and topics filters. The test checks that the filters were created correctly by comparing them to the expected filters.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the `FilterStore` class is functioning correctly and that it can create, save, and remove filters for the Ethereum blockchain. The test suite also ensures that the `FilterStore` class can create address and topics filters correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FilterStore` class?
- The `FilterStore` class is used to create, save, and manage different types of filters, such as block filters and log filters, for the Nethermind blockchain.

2. What is the purpose of the `Can_get_filters_by_type` test?
- The `Can_get_filters_by_type` test checks if the `FilterStore` class can correctly retrieve filters of a specific type, such as log filters or block filters.

3. What is the purpose of the `Correctly_creates_address_filter` test?
- The `Correctly_creates_address_filter` test checks if the `FilterStore` class can correctly create an address filter based on the input parameters, such as a specific address or a list of addresses.
