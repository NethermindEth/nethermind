This code is a unit test for a class called `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to trigger block production every time a new transaction is added to the transaction pool. This is achieved by subscribing to the `NewPending` event of the transaction pool and raising the `TriggerBlockProduction` event of the class.

The `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTxTests` class contains a single test method called `On_pending_trigger_works()`. This method tests whether the `TriggerBlockProduction` event is raised the correct number of times when new transactions are added to the transaction pool. The test creates a mock `ITxPool` object using the `Substitute.For<ITxPool>()` method. It then creates an instance of the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class, passing the mock `ITxPool` object as a parameter. The test then subscribes to the `TriggerBlockProduction` event of the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` instance and adds two new transactions to the transaction pool using the `Raise.EventWith()` method. Finally, the test asserts that the `TriggerBlockProduction` event was raised twice by checking the value of the `triggered` variable.

This test ensures that the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class is functioning correctly and will trigger block production every time a new transaction is added to the transaction pool. It also demonstrates how to use the `NSubstitute` library to create mock objects for testing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class?
- The `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class is used to trigger block production on each new pending transaction in the transaction pool.

2. What is the significance of the `Timeout` attribute on the `On_pending_trigger_works` test method?
- The `Timeout` attribute sets the maximum time allowed for the test to run before it is considered a failure.

3. What is the purpose of the `FluentAssertions` library in this code?
- The `FluentAssertions` library is used to provide more readable and expressive assertions in the test method.
