The `FullPruningDiskTest` class is a test suite for the `FullPruner` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `FullPruner` class is responsible for pruning the state trie of the Ethereum blockchain. Pruning is the process of removing old and unused data from the state trie to reduce its size and improve performance. The `FullPruningDiskTest` class tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class by simulating the pruning process on a test blockchain.

The `FullPruningDiskTest` class contains two test methods: `prune_on_disk_multiple_times` and `prune_on_disk_only_once`. Both methods create a `PruningTestBlockchain` object, which is a subclass of the `TestBlockchain` class. The `PruningTestBlockchain` class extends the `TestBlockchain` class by adding a `FullPruner` object, a `PruningTrigger` object, and a `PruningConfig` object. The `FullPruner` object is used to prune the state trie, the `PruningTrigger` object is used to trigger the pruning process, and the `PruningConfig` object is used to configure the pruning process.

The `prune_on_disk_multiple_times` method tests the pruning process by simulating multiple pruning cycles without any delay. The method adds blocks to the blockchain and triggers the pruning process three times. After each pruning cycle, the method checks if the state trie has been pruned and if the pruned data has been saved to disk. The method also checks if the pruned data is a subset of the original data.

The `prune_on_disk_only_once` method tests the pruning process by simulating a single pruning cycle with a delay of 10 hours. The method adds blocks to the blockchain and triggers the pruning process three times. After the first pruning cycle, the method checks if the state trie has been pruned and if the pruned data has been saved to disk. The method does not check the state trie after the second and third pruning cycles because the delay has not expired.

The `RunPruning` method is a helper method used by both test methods to simulate the pruning process. The method adds blocks to the blockchain, triggers the pruning process, waits for the pruning process to complete, and checks if the state trie has been pruned and if the pruned data has been saved to disk.

The `WriteFileStructure` method is a helper method used by the `RunPruning` method to write the file structure of the state trie to the console. The method is used for debugging purposes.

Overall, the `FullPruningDiskTest` class is an important part of the `Nethermind` project because it tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class, which is responsible for pruning the state trie of the Ethereum blockchain. The test suite ensures that the pruning process works correctly and that the pruned data is saved to disk.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FullPruningDiskTest` class?
- The `FullPruningDiskTest` class is a test class that contains two test methods for testing full pruning on disk.

2. What is the `FullTestPruner` class and what is its purpose?
- The `FullTestPruner` class is a subclass of `FullPruner` and its purpose is to run pruning on a full pruning database and signal when pruning is finished using an event wait handle.

3. What is the purpose of the `RunPruning` method and what does it do?
- The `RunPruning` method is a helper method that runs pruning on a `PruningTestBlockchain` instance and checks if pruning is finished. It also checks if the state database has been renamed and if the current state items are a subset of all items.
