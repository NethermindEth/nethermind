The `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class contains unit tests for the `BlockValidator` class, which is responsible for validating suggested blocks in the Nethermind blockchain. The tests cover different scenarios for validating suggested blocks based on the block's properties.

The first test, `Not_null_ExcessDataGas_is_invalid_pre_cancun()`, checks if a block with non-null `ExcessDataGas` is invalid before the Cancun fork. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a `CustomSpecProvider` and passes a block with a non-null `ExcessDataGas` to the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` method. The test expects the method to return `false`, indicating that the block is invalid.

The second test, `Null_ExcessDataGas_is_invalid_post_cancun()`, checks if a block with null `ExcessDataGas` is invalid after the Cancun fork. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a `CustomSpecProvider` and passes a block with a null `ExcessDataGas` to the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` method. The test expects the method to return `false`, indicating that the block is invalid.

The third test, `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid()`, checks if the number of blobs in a block is valid. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a `CustomSpecProvider` and passes a block with a specified number of blobs to the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` method. The test expects the method to return `true` if the number of blobs is less than or equal to the maximum allowed number of blobs per block, and `false` otherwise.

These tests ensure that the `BlockValidator` class is working correctly and can validate suggested blocks based on their properties. The `BlockValidator` class is an important component of the Nethermind blockchain, as it ensures that only valid blocks are added to the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class?
- The `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class is a test suite for validating suggested blocks with different parameters.

2. What is the significance of the `CustomSpecProvider` and `BlockValidator` objects?
- The `CustomSpecProvider` object provides the specifications for the block validation process, while the `BlockValidator` object performs the actual validation.

3. What is the purpose of the `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid` test case?
- The `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid` test case checks whether the number of blobs in a suggested block is within the valid range, as defined by the `Eip4844Constants.MaxBlobsPerBlock` constant.
