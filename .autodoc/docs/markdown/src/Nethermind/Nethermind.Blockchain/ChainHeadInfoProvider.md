The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for providing information about the current state of the blockchain. It implements the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface and provides methods to get the current chain head specification, account state provider, block gas limit, and current base fee. 

The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class has three constructors that take different parameters. The first constructor takes an `ISpecProvider`, an `IBlockTree`, and an `IStateReader` object. The second constructor takes an `ISpecProvider`, an `IBlockTree`, and an `IAccountStateProvider` object. The third constructor takes an `IChainHeadSpecProvider`, an `IBlockTree`, and an `IAccountStateProvider` object. 

The `SpecProvider` property returns the current chain head specification. The `AccountStateProvider` property returns the current account state provider. The `BlockGasLimit` property returns the current block gas limit. The `CurrentBaseFee` property returns the current base fee.

The `OnHeadChanged` method is called when a new block is added to the main chain. It updates the `BlockGasLimit` and `CurrentBaseFee` properties and invokes the `HeadChanged` event.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the current state of the blockchain. Other classes in the project can use the `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class to get information about the current chain head specification, account state provider, block gas limit, and current base fee. For example, the `TxPool` module can use this class to determine the current gas limit and base fee when processing transactions. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new instance of ChainHeadInfoProvider
var chainHeadInfoProvider = new ChainHeadInfoProvider(specProvider, blockTree, stateReader);

// get the current chain head specification
var spec = chainHeadInfoProvider.SpecProvider.GetSpec();

// get the current account state provider
var accountStateProvider = chainHeadInfoProvider.AccountStateProvider;

// get the current block gas limit
var blockGasLimit = chainHeadInfoProvider.BlockGasLimit;

// get the current base fee
var currentBaseFee = chainHeadInfoProvider.CurrentBaseFee;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class?
    
    The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class is an implementation of the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface and provides information about the current chain head, including the gas limit and current base fee.

2. What are the parameters of the constructor for `ChainHeadInfoProvider`?
    
    The constructor for `ChainHeadInfoProvider` takes an `ISpecProvider` object, an `IBlockTree` object, and an `IAccountStateProvider` object as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `OnHeadChanged` method?
    
    The `OnHeadChanged` method is an event handler that updates the `BlockGasLimit` and `CurrentBaseFee` properties of the `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class when a new block is added to the main chain.
