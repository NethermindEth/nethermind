This file contains several enums and an extension method for the `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` enum. These enums are used to define various options that can be passed to methods in the `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace related to the block tree data structure.

The `BlockTreeLookupOptions` enum defines options for looking up a block in the block tree. These options include whether or not to require the total difficulty of the block, whether or not to require the block to be canonical, and whether or not to create a new level in the block tree if it is missing.

The `BlockTreeInsertHeaderOptions` enum defines options for inserting a block header into the block tree. These options include whether or not to require the total difficulty of the block, whether or not to include metadata related to the Beacon chain, and whether or not to insert the block on the main chain or a side chain.

The `BlockTreeInsertBlockOptions` enum defines options for inserting a full block into the block tree. These options include whether or not to save the block header, and whether or not to skip checking if new blocks can be accepted. The latter option is used to allow old bodies and receipts to sync at the same time as an invalid block without blocking the block tree.

The `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` enum defines options for suggesting a block to be added to the block tree. These options include whether or not the block should be processed, whether or not to fill in missing Beacon blocks during sync, and whether or not to force the block to be set as the main block or not. The `BlockTreeSuggestOptionsExtensions` class provides an extension method for checking if a given `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` value contains a specific flag.

These enums are used throughout the `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace to provide flexibility and control over the behavior of the block tree data structure. For example, the `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` enum is used in the `IBlockTree.SuggestBlock` method to allow callers to specify how a block should be added to the block tree. By using these enums, the behavior of the block tree can be customized to fit the specific needs of the application using the Nethermind library.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockTreeLookupOptions` enum?
   - The `BlockTreeLookupOptions` enum is used to specify options for looking up blocks in a block tree, such as whether to require canonical blocks or not.

2. What is the difference between `BlockTreeInsertHeaderOptions.BeaconBlockInsert` and `BlockTreeInsertHeaderOptions.BeaconHeaderInsert`?
   - `BlockTreeInsertHeaderOptions.BeaconBlockInsert` is used to insert a full beacon block into the block tree, while `BlockTreeInsertHeaderOptions.BeaconHeaderInsert` is used to insert only the header of a beacon block into the block tree.

3. What is the purpose of the `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` enum?
   - The `BlockTreeSuggestOptions` enum is used to specify options for suggesting blocks to be added to a block tree, such as whether to force a block to be set as the main block or not.
