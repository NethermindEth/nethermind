[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Blockchain/KnownChainSizes.cs)

The code defines a static class called `Known` that contains a dictionary called `ChainSize`. The dictionary maps blockchain IDs to a `SizeInfo` struct that contains information about the size of the blockchain, its daily growth rate, and the date of manual update. The `SizeInfo` struct has three properties: `SizeAtUpdateDate`, `DailyGrowth`, and `UpdateDate`. It also has a `Current` property that calculates the current size of the blockchain based on the size at the update date and the daily growth rate.

This code is likely used to keep track of the size of various blockchains in the Nethermind project. The `ChainSize` dictionary can be used to look up the size information for a specific blockchain ID. The `SizeInfo` struct provides a convenient way to store and access the size information for a blockchain. The `Current` property of the `SizeInfo` struct can be used to calculate the current size of a blockchain based on the size at the update date and the daily growth rate.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
using Nethermind.Blockchain;

// Get the size information for the mainnet blockchain
Known.SizeInfo mainnetSizeInfo = Known.ChainSize[BlockchainIds.Mainnet];

// Calculate the current size of the mainnet blockchain
long mainnetCurrentSize = mainnetSizeInfo.Current;

// Print the current size of the mainnet blockchain
Console.WriteLine($"Mainnet current size: {mainnetCurrentSize} bytes");
```

This code would output the current size of the mainnet blockchain in bytes based on the size information stored in the `ChainSize` dictionary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Known` class and what does it contain?
- The `Known` class is a static class that contains a dictionary of blockchain sizes (`ChainSize`) and a `SizeInfo` struct that holds information about the size of a blockchain, its daily growth rate, and the date of manual update.

2. What is the significance of the `SizeInfo` struct and its properties?
- The `SizeInfo` struct holds information about the size of a blockchain, its daily growth rate, and the date of manual update. Its properties include `SizeAtUpdateDate` (the size of the blockchain at the time of manual update), `DailyGrowth` (the daily growth rate of the blockchain), `UpdateDate` (the date of manual update), and `Current` (the current size of the blockchain based on the time elapsed since the manual update).

3. What are the blockchain IDs and their corresponding size information in the `ChainSize` dictionary?
- The `ChainSize` dictionary contains the size information for several blockchains, including Goerli, Rinkeby, Ropsten, Mainnet, Gnosis, EnergyWeb, Volta, and PoaCore. The size information includes the size of the blockchain at the time of manual update, its daily growth rate, and the date of manual update.
