This code defines an enum called `SendBlockMode` within the `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace. The purpose of this enum is to provide two options for how a block should be sent within the blockchain system. 

The first option is `FullBlock`, which indicates that the entire block should be sent. This means that all of the transactions within the block will be included in the message that is sent. 

The second option is `HashOnly`, which indicates that only the hash of the block should be sent. This means that the recipient of the message will not receive the full block, but will instead receive a hash that can be used to verify the block's authenticity. 

This enum is likely used in various parts of the Nethermind project where blocks need to be sent or received. For example, it may be used in the code that handles block propagation between nodes in the blockchain network. 

Here is an example of how this enum might be used in code:

```
using Nethermind.Blockchain;

public class BlockSender
{
    public void SendBlock(Block block, SendBlockMode mode)
    {
        if (mode == SendBlockMode.FullBlock)
        {
            // send the full block
        }
        else if (mode == SendBlockMode.HashOnly)
        {
            // send only the block hash
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SendBlock` method takes a `Block` object and a `SendBlockMode` enum value as parameters. Depending on the value of the `mode` parameter, the method will either send the full block or just the block hash. This allows for flexibility in how blocks are sent and received within the blockchain system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SendBlockMode` enum?
   - The `SendBlockMode` enum is used to specify whether a full block or just the block hash should be sent in a message.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released and is used to ensure compliance with open source licensing requirements.

3. What is the namespace `Nethermind.Blockchain` used for?
   - The `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace is used to group together related classes and interfaces that are used in the blockchain functionality of the Nethermind project.
