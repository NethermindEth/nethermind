The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for finding transaction receipts for a given block. It implements the `IReceiptFinder` interface and provides methods to retrieve transaction receipts for a block by either block hash or block object. 

The class takes three parameters in its constructor: `IReceiptStorage`, `IReceiptsRecovery`, and `IBlockFinder`. These parameters are used to retrieve and recover transaction receipts for a block. 

The `FindBlockHash` method takes a transaction hash as input and returns the block hash for the block that contains the transaction. 

The `Get` method takes a `Block` object as input and returns an array of `TxReceipt` objects. It first retrieves the receipts for the block from the `_receiptStorage` object. If the `_receiptsRecovery` object determines that the receipts need to be recovered, the receipts are reinserted into the `_receiptStorage` object. The method then returns the receipts. 

The `Get` method also has an overload that takes a block hash as input instead of a `Block` object. This method retrieves the receipts for the block with the given hash from the `_receiptStorage` object. If the `_receiptsRecovery` object determines that the receipts need to be recovered, the method uses the `_blockFinder` object to retrieve the block object and then reinserts the receipts into the `_receiptStorage` object. The method then returns the receipts. 

The `CanGetReceiptsByHash` method takes a block number as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the receipts for the block with the given number can be retrieved from the `_receiptStorage` object. 

The `TryGetReceiptsIterator` method takes a block number and block hash as input and returns a boolean indicating whether a `ReceiptsIterator` object can be retrieved from the `_receiptStorage` object. 

Overall, the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class provides a way to retrieve transaction receipts for a block and recover them if necessary. It is an important part of the Nethermind project's blockchain functionality. 

Example usage:

```
IReceiptStorage receiptStorage = new MyReceiptStorage();
IReceiptsRecovery receiptsRecovery = new MyReceiptsRecovery();
IBlockFinder blockFinder = new MyBlockFinder();

FullInfoReceiptFinder receiptFinder = new FullInfoReceiptFinder(receiptStorage, receiptsRecovery, blockFinder);

Keccak txHash = new Keccak("0x123abc");
Keccak blockHash = receiptFinder.FindBlockHash(txHash);

Block block = new Block();
TxReceipt[] receipts = receiptFinder.Get(block);

receipts = receiptFinder.Get(blockHash);

bool canGetReceipts = receiptFinder.CanGetReceiptsByHash(12345);

bool success = receiptFinder.TryGetReceiptsIterator(12345, blockHash, out ReceiptsIterator iterator);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class is an implementation of the `IReceiptFinder` interface and is responsible for finding and retrieving transaction receipts for a given block.

2. What are the dependencies of the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class has three dependencies: `IReceiptStorage`, `IReceiptsRecovery`, and `IBlockFinder`.

3. What is the purpose of the `Get` method in the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `Get` method in the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class retrieves transaction receipts for a given block. If the receipts need to be recovered, it attempts to recover them and reinsert them into the storage.
