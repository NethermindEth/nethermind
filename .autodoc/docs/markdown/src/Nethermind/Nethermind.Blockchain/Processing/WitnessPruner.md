The code provided is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for synchronizing the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, it is a module that prunes the witness data from the blockchain. The witness data is used to verify the validity of the transactions and blocks on the blockchain. It is stored in a separate database called the witness repository. The purpose of this module is to remove the witness data from the repository for blocks that are older than a certain number of blocks, which is determined by the followDistance parameter.

The code consists of two classes: WitnessCollectorExtensions and WitnessPruner. The WitnessCollectorExtensions class is a static class that provides an extension method for the IWitnessRepository interface. The WithPruning method takes an instance of the IWitnessRepository interface, an instance of the IBlockTree interface, an instance of the ILogManager interface, and an optional followDistance parameter. It creates an instance of the WitnessPruner class and starts it. The WitnessPruner class is responsible for pruning the witness data.

The WitnessPruner class takes an instance of the IBlockTree interface, an instance of the IWitnessRepository interface, an instance of the ILogManager interface, and an optional followDistance parameter. It subscribes to the NewHeadBlock event of the IBlockTree interface. When a new block is added to the blockchain, the OnNewHeadBlock method is called. This method calculates the number of blocks to prune based on the followDistance parameter and deletes the witness data for those blocks from the repository.

In summary, the WitnessCollectorExtensions and WitnessPruner classes are used to prune the witness data from the blockchain. The WitnessCollectorExtensions class provides an extension method for the IWitnessRepository interface that creates an instance of the WitnessPruner class and starts it. The WitnessPruner class subscribes to the NewHeadBlock event of the IBlockTree interface and prunes the witness data for blocks that are older than a certain number of blocks. This module is an important part of the Nethermind project as it helps to optimize the storage of the witness data and improve the performance of the blockchain synchronization process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WitnessCollectorExtensions` class and its `WithPruning` method?
   
   The `WitnessCollectorExtensions` class provides an extension method `WithPruning` for `IWitnessRepository` instances that takes an `IBlockTree`, an `ILogManager`, and an optional `followDistance` parameter. The purpose of this method is to add a witness pruner to the repository that will remove old witnesses from blocks that are no longer within the specified distance from the current head block.

2. What is the `WitnessPruner` class responsible for?
   
   The `WitnessPruner` class is responsible for pruning witnesses from blocks that are no longer within a specified distance from the current head block. It does this by subscribing to the `NewHeadBlock` event of an `IBlockTree` instance and deleting witnesses for blocks that are beyond the specified distance.

3. What is the purpose of the `ILogger` instance used in the `WitnessPruner` class?
   
   The `ILogger` instance used in the `WitnessPruner` class is used to log messages when witnesses are being pruned. Specifically, when witnesses are being deleted for blocks that are beyond the specified distance, a trace message is logged if the logger's `IsTrace` property is `true`.
