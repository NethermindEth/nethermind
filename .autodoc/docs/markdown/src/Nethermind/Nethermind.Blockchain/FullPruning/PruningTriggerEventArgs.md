This code defines a class called `PruningTriggerEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. The purpose of this class is to provide an event argument for the `FullPruning` class in the Nethermind blockchain project. 

The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class has a single property called `Status` which is of type `PruningStatus`. This property is used to store the result of triggering full pruning in the blockchain. The `PruningStatus` is an enum that represents the different states of the pruning process, such as `Started`, `Completed`, `Failed`, etc.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the status of the full pruning process. Full pruning is a process in which old and unused data is removed from the blockchain to reduce its size and improve performance. This process is triggered periodically to ensure that the blockchain remains efficient and scalable.

An example of how this class may be used in the Nethermind project is as follows:

```
public class FullPruning
{
    public event EventHandler<PruningTriggerEventArgs> PruningTriggered;

    public void TriggerPruning()
    {
        // Code to trigger full pruning

        // Raise the PruningTriggered event with the result of the pruning process
        PruningTriggered?.Invoke(this, new PruningTriggerEventArgs { Status = PruningStatus.Completed });
    }
}
```

In this example, the `FullPruning` class has an event called `PruningTriggered` which is raised when the full pruning process is triggered. The event handler for this event takes an instance of the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class as its second argument, which contains the result of the pruning process. The `TriggerPruning` method is responsible for triggering the full pruning process and raising the `PruningTriggered` event with the appropriate `PruningStatus`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class?
   - The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class is used to define the event arguments for the Full Pruning trigger event.

2. What is the `PruningStatus` property and what values can it hold?
   - The `PruningStatus` property is a property of the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class and holds the result of triggering Full Pruning. It can hold values such as `Started`, `Completed`, `Failed`, etc.

3. What namespace does the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class belong to?
   - The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class belongs to the `Nethermind.Blockchain.FullPruning` namespace.
