The `CompositePruningTrigger` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to allow multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched. This class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to help manage the pruning of data from the blockchain.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to add multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to a single object, which can then be used to trigger pruning events. The `Add` method is used to add a new `IPruningTrigger` to the object, which is then watched for pruning events. When a pruning event occurs, the `OnPrune` method is called, which in turn invokes the `Prune` event.

The `Prune` event is an event that is raised when pruning is required. This event is used to notify other parts of the system that pruning needs to occur. The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class is used to pass information about the pruning event to the event handler.

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```
var compositeTrigger = new CompositePruningTrigger();
var trigger1 = new MyPruningTrigger1();
var trigger2 = new MyPruningTrigger2();

compositeTrigger.Add(trigger1);
compositeTrigger.Add(trigger2);

compositeTrigger.Prune += (sender, args) =>
{
    // Handle pruning event
};
```

In this example, two `IPruningTrigger`s are added to the `CompositePruningTrigger` object using the `Add` method. Then, a handler is attached to the `Prune` event to handle pruning events. When a pruning event occurs, the handler will be called and can take appropriate action.

Overall, the `CompositePruningTrigger` class is an important part of the Nethermind project and is used to manage the pruning of data from the blockchain. By allowing multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched, this class provides a flexible and extensible way to manage pruning events.
## Questions:
