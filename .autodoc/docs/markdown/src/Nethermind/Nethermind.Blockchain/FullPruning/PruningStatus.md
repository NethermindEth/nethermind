[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Blockchain/FullPruning/PruningStatus.cs)

This code defines an enum called `PruningStatus` that represents the status of full pruning in the Nethermind blockchain. Full pruning is a process of removing old data from the blockchain to reduce its size and improve performance. 

The `PruningStatus` enum has four possible values: `Disabled`, `Delayed`, `InProgress`, and `Starting`. 

- `Disabled` is the default value, which means that full pruning is not enabled. 
- `Delayed` means that full pruning is temporarily disabled because there has not been enough time since the previous successful pruning. 
- `InProgress` means that full pruning is currently in progress. 
- `Starting` means that full pruning has been triggered and is about to start. 

The `JsonConverter` attribute is used to specify that the enum should be serialized and deserialized as a string using the `StringEnumConverter` class from the Newtonsoft.Json library. This allows the enum values to be represented as strings in JSON format. 

This code is important for the Nethermind blockchain because it provides a way to track the status of full pruning. Other parts of the code can use this enum to determine whether full pruning is enabled, disabled, or in progress, and take appropriate actions based on that information. For example, if full pruning is in progress, other parts of the code may need to wait until it is complete before performing certain operations. 

Here is an example of how this enum might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```csharp
PruningStatus status = GetPruningStatus();
if (status == PruningStatus.Disabled)
{
    // Full pruning is not enabled, so we don't need to do anything.
}
else if (status == PruningStatus.Delayed)
{
    // Full pruning is temporarily disabled, so we need to wait before trying again.
    WaitForPruning();
}
else if (status == PruningStatus.InProgress)
{
    // Full pruning is currently in progress, so we need to wait until it is complete.
    WaitForPruningCompletion();
}
else if (status == PruningStatus.Starting)
{
    // Full pruning has been triggered and is about to start, so we need to prepare for it.
    PrepareForPruning();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an enum called `PruningStatus` that represents the status of full pruning in the Nethermind blockchain.
2. What is the significance of the `JsonConverter` attribute?
   - The `JsonConverter` attribute specifies that the `StringEnumConverter` should be used to serialize and deserialize the `PruningStatus` enum to and from JSON.
3. What are the possible values of the `PruningStatus` enum?
   - The `PruningStatus` enum has four possible values: `Disabled`, `Delayed`, `InProgress`, and `Starting`, each with a corresponding summary comment describing its meaning.
