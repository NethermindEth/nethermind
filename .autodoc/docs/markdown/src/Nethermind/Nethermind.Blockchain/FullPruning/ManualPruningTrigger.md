The `ManualPruningTrigger` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to manually trigger full pruning. Full pruning is a process of removing old and unnecessary data from the blockchain to reduce its size and improve performance. This class implements the `IPruningTrigger` interface, which defines the contract for triggering full pruning.

The `ManualPruningTrigger` class has an event `Prune` of type `EventHandler<PruningTriggerEventArgs>`. This event is raised when full pruning is triggered. The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class contains information about the status of the pruning process.

The `Trigger` method is used to trigger full pruning. It raises the `Prune` event and returns the status of the pruning process. The `Prune` event is raised with the `this` object and an instance of `PruningTriggerEventArgs` as arguments. The `Prune` event is null-conditional, meaning that it will only be raised if there are subscribers to the event.

Here is an example of how to use the `ManualPruningTrigger` class:

```csharp
ManualPruningTrigger pruningTrigger = new ManualPruningTrigger();
pruningTrigger.Prune += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Pruning status: {args.Status}");
};
PruningStatus status = pruningTrigger.Trigger();
Console.WriteLine($"Trigger status: {status}");
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `ManualPruningTrigger` class and subscribe to the `Prune` event. When the `Trigger` method is called, the `Prune` event is raised and the status of the pruning process is printed to the console. The status of the triggering process is also printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IPruningTrigger` interface that `ManualPruningTrigger` implements?
- The `IPruningTrigger` interface likely defines a set of methods or properties that allow for triggering pruning in some way.

2. What is the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class and what information does it contain?
- The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class is likely an event argument class that contains information related to the pruning trigger event, such as the status of the pruning.

3. What is the significance of the `Prune` event and how is it used?
- The `Prune` event is likely used to notify subscribers that pruning has been triggered. In this case, it is used to invoke the event and pass along the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` object.
