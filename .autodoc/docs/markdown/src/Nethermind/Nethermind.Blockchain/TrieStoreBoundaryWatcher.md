The `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` class is a component of the Nethermind blockchain project that watches state persistence in an `ITrieStore` instance and saves it in an `IBlockFinder.BestPersistedState` instance. 

The `ITrieStore` interface is a key-value store that is used to store the state of the blockchain. The `IBlockFinder` interface is used to find blocks in the blockchain. The `IBlockTree` interface is a tree structure that represents the blockchain. The `ILogger` interface is used to log messages.

The `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` class is initialized with an `ITrieStore` instance, an `IBlockTree` instance, and an `ILogManager` instance. When the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` instance is created, it subscribes to the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event of the `ITrieStore` instance. When the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event is raised, the `OnReorgBoundaryReached` method is called. This method saves the reorg boundary block number in the `IBlockFinder.BestPersistedState` instance.

The `Dispose` method is used to unsubscribe from the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event when the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` instance is no longer needed.

This class is used to keep track of the state of the blockchain and ensure that it is persisted correctly. It is an important component of the Nethermind blockchain project and is used in conjunction with other components to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. 

Example usage:

```csharp
ITrieStore trieStore = new TrieStore();
IBlockTree blockTree = new BlockTree();
ILogManager logManager = new LogManager();
TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher watcher = new TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher(trieStore, blockTree, logManager);
// Use the trieStore and blockTree instances
watcher.Dispose();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` class?
    
    The purpose of the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` class is to watch state persistence in `ITrieStore` with `ITrieStore.ReorgBoundaryReached` and save it in `IBlockFinder.BestPersistedState`.

2. What are the parameters of the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` constructor?
    
    The parameters of the `TrieStoreBoundaryWatcher` constructor are `ITrieStore trieStore`, `IBlockTree blockTree`, and `ILogManager logManager`.

3. What does the `OnReorgBoundaryReached` method do?
    
    The `OnReorgBoundaryReached` method saves the reorg boundary block number in `_blockTree.BestPersistedState` and logs the event if `_logger.IsDebug` is true.
