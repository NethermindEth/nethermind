The code above defines an interface and an extension method for the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) configuration in the Nethermind project. MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from a block by a miner or other participants in the transaction ordering process. The MEV configuration interface, `IMevConfig`, extends the `IConfig` interface and defines several properties that can be used to configure MEV-related settings. 

The `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether MEV bundles are allowed. MEV bundles are groups of transactions that are submitted together to maximize the value extracted from a block. The `BundleHorizon` property is a `UInt256` value that defines how long MEV bundles will be kept in memory by clients. The `BundlePoolSize` property is an integer that defines the maximum number of MEV bundles that can be kept in memory by clients. The `MaxMergedBundles` property is an integer that defines the maximum number of MEV bundles to be included within a single block. Finally, the `TrustedRelays` property is a string that defines the list of trusted relay addresses to receive megabundles from as a comma-separated string.

The `MevConfigExtensions` class defines an extension method `GetTrustedRelayAddresses` that can be used to retrieve the list of trusted relay addresses from the `TrustedRelays` property. This method splits the `TrustedRelays` string by comma, removes any empty or whitespace-only entries, and creates a new `Address` object for each distinct address in the resulting list. 

Overall, this code provides a way to configure and retrieve MEV-related settings in the Nethermind project. It can be used by developers who want to customize the behavior of MEV bundles and trusted relay addresses in their applications. For example, a developer might use the `IMevConfig` interface to enable MEV bundles and set the maximum number of merged bundles to 2, and then use the `GetTrustedRelayAddresses` method to retrieve the list of trusted relay addresses and use them to filter incoming megabundles.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IMevConfig` interface?
    - The `IMevConfig` interface defines a set of configuration options related to MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bundles.
2. What is the significance of the `MevConfigExtensions` class?
    - The `MevConfigExtensions` class provides an extension method `GetTrustedRelayAddresses` that returns a list of trusted relay addresses based on the `TrustedRelays` configuration option.
3. What is the purpose of the `UInt256` type?
    - The `UInt256` type is used to represent a 256-bit unsigned integer and is used as the type for the `BundleHorizon` configuration option.
