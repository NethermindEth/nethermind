The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for tracing the execution of transactions within a block and generating receipts for each transaction. It implements the `IBlockTracer`, `ITxTracer`, and `IJournal<int>` interfaces.

The class maintains a list of transaction receipts (`_txReceipts`) and provides methods for adding successful or failed receipts to the list. It also provides methods for reporting various aspects of the transaction execution such as gas usage, memory changes, storage changes, balance changes, and code changes. These methods are called by the `ITxTracer` interface during the execution of a transaction.

The class also provides methods for reporting block-level information such as the block hash and rewards. These methods are called by the `IBlockTracer` interface during the execution of a block.

The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is designed to work with other tracers, which can be set using the `SetOtherTracer` method. This allows for nested tracing of transactions and blocks.

Overall, the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class plays an important role in the Nethermind project by providing a way to trace the execution of transactions and generate receipts that can be used for various purposes such as debugging, auditing, and analytics.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class?
- The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is a tracer for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions and blocks that is used to build transaction receipts.

2. What interfaces does the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class implement?
- The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class implements the `IBlockTracer`, `ITxTracer`, and `IJournal<int>` interfaces.

3. What is the purpose of the `MarkAsSuccess` and `MarkAsFailed` methods?
- The `MarkAsSuccess` and `MarkAsFailed` methods are used to add successful or failed transaction receipts to the list of receipts being built by the tracer. They also support nested receipt tracers.
