The `FeesTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to trace transaction fees. It implements the `IBlockTracer` and `ITxTracer` interfaces, which define methods to trace blocks and transactions, respectively. 

The class has several boolean properties that indicate which types of tracing are enabled. In this case, only `IsTracingFees` is set to `true`. The class also has two public properties, `Fees` and `BurntFees`, which are both of type `UInt256`. These properties are used to keep track of the total fees and burnt fees for a given block or transaction. 

The `ReportFees` method is used to update the `Fees` and `BurntFees` properties with the fees and burnt fees for a given transaction. The `StartNewBlockTrace` method is called at the beginning of a new block to reset the `Fees` and `BurntFees` properties. The `StartNewTxTrace` method is called at the beginning of a new transaction and returns the current instance of the `FeesTracer` class. The `EndTxTrace` and `EndBlockTrace` methods are called at the end of a transaction and block, respectively, but do not perform any actions in this implementation.

The remaining methods in the class are not implemented and throw `NotImplementedException`. These methods are defined in the `ITxTracer` and `IBlockTracer` interfaces and are used to trace various aspects of transactions and blocks, such as storage changes, memory changes, and gas usage. 

Overall, the `FeesTracer` class is a simple implementation of a transaction fee tracer that can be used in conjunction with other tracers to provide a more complete picture of the state changes and gas usage in a given block or transaction.
## Questions:
