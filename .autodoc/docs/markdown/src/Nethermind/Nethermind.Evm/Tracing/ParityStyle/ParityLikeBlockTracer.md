The `ParityLikeBlockTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for tracing the execution of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions in a Parity-like manner. The class extends the `BlockTracerBase` class and provides functionality for tracing the execution of transactions in a block. 

The class has three constructors, each of which initializes the `_types` and `_typesByTransaction` fields. The `_types` field is of type `ParityTraceTypes` and is used to specify the types of traces to be performed. The `_typesByTransaction` field is of type `IDictionary<Keccak, ParityTraceTypes>` and is used to specify the types of traces to be performed for each transaction in a block. 

The `OnStart` method is called when a transaction is started and returns a new instance of the `ParityLikeTxTracer` class. The `OnEnd` method is called when a transaction is completed and returns a new instance of the `ParityLikeTxTrace` class. 

The `IsTracingRewards` property is a boolean value that indicates whether the tracer is tracing rewards. The `ReportReward` method is used to report rewards for a transaction. The method takes in an `Address` object, a `string` value for the reward type, and a `UInt256` value for the reward amount. The method then sets the `Action` property of the last transaction trace to a new instance of the `ParityTraceAction` class with the specified reward information. 

The `StartNewBlockTrace` method is used to start tracing a new block. The method takes in a `Block` object and sets the `_block` field to the specified block. 

Overall, the `ParityLikeBlockTracer` class provides functionality for tracing the execution of EVM transactions in a Parity-like manner. It can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide detailed information about the execution of transactions in a block. 

Example usage:

```
ParityTraceTypes types = ParityTraceTypes.All;
ParityLikeBlockTracer tracer = new ParityLikeBlockTracer(types);
Block block = new Block();
tracer.StartNewBlockTrace(block);
Transaction tx = new Transaction();
ParityLikeTxTracer txTracer = tracer.OnStart(tx);
// execute transaction
ParityLikeTxTrace txTrace = tracer.OnEnd(txTracer);
tracer.ReportReward(new Address(), "reward", new UInt256());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ParityLikeBlockTracer` class?
- The `ParityLikeBlockTracer` class is a block tracer that extends `BlockTracerBase` and is used to trace transactions in a block in a Parity-like style.

2. What is the significance of the `ParityTraceTypes` enum?
- The `ParityTraceTypes` enum is used to specify the types of traces to be performed during tracing, such as tracing rewards.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReportReward` method?
- The `ReportReward` method is used to report a reward action in the trace of a transaction, by updating the `Action` property of the last transaction trace with the reward details.
