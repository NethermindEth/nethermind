The `TransactionTests` class is a test suite for Ethereum transactions. It contains a set of test cases that verify the correctness of transaction data parsing and validation. The tests are based on a set of JSON files that contain transaction data and expected results. The JSON files are organized into directories based on the type of test they represent.

The `LoadTests` method is responsible for loading the JSON files and parsing them into a list of `TransactionTest` objects. Each `TransactionTest` object represents a single test case and contains the transaction data in RLP format, along with other metadata such as the network and test name.

The `SetUp` method sets the current directory to the base directory of the application domain. This is necessary to ensure that the JSON files can be found and loaded correctly.

The test cases are implemented as methods that take a `TransactionTest` object as input and run the test using the `RunTest` method. The `RunTest` method decodes the RLP-encoded transaction data and validates it using the `TxValidator` class. If the transaction is valid, the method also verifies the signature using the `EthereumEcdsa` class.

The `ValidTransactionTest` class is a subclass of `TransactionTest` that contains additional fields for the expected transaction data. This class is used for tests that expect a valid transaction.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive set of tests for Ethereum transactions. It ensures that transaction data is correctly parsed and validated, and that signatures are verified correctly. The test cases are organized into directories based on the type of test they represent, making it easy to add new tests or modify existing ones.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionTests` class?
- The `TransactionTests` class is a test suite for testing various aspects of Ethereum transactions, such as address, data, gas limit, gas price, nonce, signature, and value.

2. What is the purpose of the `LoadTests` method?
- The `LoadTests` method loads transaction test data from JSON files and converts them into a list of `TransactionTest` objects that can be used as input for the test methods in the `TransactionTests` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `RunTest` method?
- The `RunTest` method takes a `TransactionTest` object and an `IReleaseSpec` object as input, decodes the RLP-encoded transaction data from the `TransactionTest` object, validates the transaction using the `TxValidator` class, and verifies the transaction signature using the `EthereumEcdsa` class. If the `TransactionTest` object is a `ValidTransactionTest`, it also checks that the decoded transaction data matches the expected values.
