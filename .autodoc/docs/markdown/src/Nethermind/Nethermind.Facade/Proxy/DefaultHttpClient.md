The `DefaultHttpClient` class is a wrapper around the `HttpClient` class in the .NET framework. It provides methods for sending HTTP GET and POST requests to a specified endpoint, with optional payload data. The class is designed to handle retries in case of network errors or other exceptions.

The constructor takes an instance of `HttpClient`, an instance of `IJsonSerializer`, an instance of `ILogManager`, and two optional parameters for the number of retries and the delay between retries. The `HttpClient` instance is used to send the HTTP requests, while the `IJsonSerializer` instance is used to serialize and deserialize JSON data. The `ILogManager` instance is used to log messages.

The class provides two public methods for sending HTTP requests: `GetAsync` and `PostJsonAsync`. The `GetAsync` method sends an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint and returns the response as an instance of the specified type `T`. The `PostJsonAsync` method sends an HTTP POST request to the specified endpoint with the specified payload data, and returns the response as an instance of the specified type `T`.

The class also provides a private method `ExecuteAsync` that handles retries in case of exceptions. It takes the HTTP method, endpoint, payload data, and cancellation token as parameters, and returns the response as an instance of the specified type `T`. The method uses a `do-while` loop to retry the request in case of exceptions, up to the specified number of retries. The delay between retries is also configurable.

The private method `ProcessRequestAsync` is used to send the HTTP request and handle the response. It takes the HTTP method, endpoint, payload data, and cancellation token as parameters, and returns the response as an instance of the specified type `T`. The method uses the `HttpClient` instance to send the HTTP request, and the `IJsonSerializer` instance to deserialize the response content.

Overall, the `DefaultHttpClient` class provides a simple and flexible way to send HTTP requests and handle retries in a .NET application. It can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as communicating with a REST API or a web service. Here is an example of how to use the `DefaultHttpClient` class to send an HTTP GET request:

```
var client = new HttpClient();
var serializer = new JsonSerializer();
var logger = new ConsoleLogger();
var httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(client, serializer, logger);

var response = await httpClient.GetAsync<MyResponse>("https://example.com/api/data");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultHttpClient` class?
- The `DefaultHttpClient` class is a proxy facade that provides methods for sending HTTP GET and POST requests and handling retries.

2. What dependencies does the `DefaultHttpClient` class have?
- The `DefaultHttpClient` class depends on `HttpClient`, `IJsonSerializer`, `ILogManager`, and `ILogger`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExecuteAsync` method?
- The `ExecuteAsync` method sends an HTTP request using the specified method, endpoint, and payload, and handles retries if the request fails. It returns the deserialized response content as an object of type `T`.
