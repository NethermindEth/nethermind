The code above defines a struct called `SyncingResult` within the `Nethermind.Facade.Eth` namespace. This struct is used to represent the result of a synchronization process between a node and the Ethereum network. 

The `SyncingResult` struct has four properties: `IsSyncing`, `StartingBlock`, `CurrentBlock`, and `HighestBlock`. `IsSyncing` is a boolean value that indicates whether the node is currently syncing with the network. `StartingBlock` is the block number from which the synchronization started, `CurrentBlock` is the current block number being synced, and `HighestBlock` is the highest block number in the network.

The `SyncingResult` struct also has a static property called `NotSyncing`, which is an instance of the struct with default property values. This property is used to indicate that the node is not currently syncing with the network.

This struct is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the synchronization status of a node. For example, it could be used by a user interface to display the current syncing progress of a node. 

Here is an example of how this struct could be used in code:

```
SyncingResult syncingResult = GetSyncingResult();
if (syncingResult.IsSyncing)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Syncing in progress: {syncingResult.CurrentBlock} / {syncingResult.HighestBlock}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Node is not currently syncing.");
}
```

In this example, the `GetSyncingResult()` method returns an instance of the `SyncingResult` struct. If the `IsSyncing` property is `true`, the current syncing progress is displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating that the node is not currently syncing is displayed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncingResult` struct?
   - The `SyncingResult` struct is used to represent the result of a syncing operation in the Ethereum network.

2. What does the `NotSyncing` static field represent?
   - The `NotSyncing` static field represents a `SyncingResult` instance that indicates that the node is not currently syncing with the network.

3. What information does the `ToString` method return?
   - The `ToString` method returns a string representation of the `SyncingResult` instance, including whether the node is syncing, the starting block, the current block, and the highest block.
