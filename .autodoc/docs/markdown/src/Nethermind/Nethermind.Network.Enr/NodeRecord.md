The NodeRecord class represents an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) as defined in EIP-778. ENR is a data structure that contains metadata about an Ethereum node, such as its IP address, port, and supported protocols. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to create, modify, and serialize ENRs.

The class contains several fields and properties that represent different parts of an ENR. The EnrSequence property represents the version/ID/sequence of the node record data. It should be increased by one with each update to the node data. The EnrString property is a base64 string representing a node record with the 'enr:' prefix. The ContentHash property is a hash of the content, i.e. Keccak([seq, k, v, ...]) as defined in EIP-778. The Signature property is a signature resulting from a secp256k1 signing of the [seq, k, v, ...] content.

The class also contains methods for setting and getting ENR entries. Entries are automatically sorted by keys. The SetEntry method sets one of the record entries. The GetValue method gets a record entry value (in case of the value types). The GetObj method gets a record entry value (in case of the ref types). The EncodeContent method applies Rlp([seq, k, v, ...]]). The Encode method applies Rlp([signature, seq, k, v, ...]]). The CreateEnrString method creates a base64 string representing a node record with the 'enr:' prefix.

Overall, the NodeRecord class provides a way to create, modify, and serialize ENRs. It is used in the larger Nethermind project to represent metadata about Ethereum nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `NodeRecord` which represents an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) as defined in EIP-778.

2. What is the significance of the `EnrSequence` property?
- The `EnrSequence` property represents the version/id/sequence of the node record data and should be increased by one with each update to the node data. Setting sequence on this class wipes out `EnrString` and `ContentHash`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetHex()` method?
- The `GetHex()` method is added for diagnostic purposes and returns the Rlp([signature, seq, k, v, ...]) as a hex string.
