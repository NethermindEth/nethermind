The `AccountAbstractionRpcModule` class is a module that provides an interface for interacting with the user operation pool in the Nethermind project. It implements the `IAccountAbstractionRpcModule` interface and contains two methods: `eth_sendUserOperation` and `eth_supportedEntryPoints`.

The `eth_sendUserOperation` method takes a `UserOperationRpc` object and an `entryPointAddress` as parameters. It first checks if the `entryPointAddress` is supported by the module by checking if it is contained in the `_supportedEntryPoints` array. If it is not supported, the method returns a failure result with an error message. If it is supported, the method checks if any entry point has both the sender and the same nonce as the `UserOperationRpc` object. If there is an existing operation with the same sender and nonce, the method checks if the fee of the new operation is large enough to replace the existing operation. If it is not, the method returns a failure result with an error message. If there is no existing operation with the same sender and nonce or the fee of the new operation is large enough to replace the existing operation, the method adds the new operation to the user operation pool associated with the `entryPointAddress` and returns a success result with the hash of the operation.

The `eth_supportedEntryPoints` method returns a success result with an array of supported entry points.

This module is used to provide an interface for users to submit user operations to the Nethermind network. The `eth_sendUserOperation` method checks if the submitted operation is valid and can be added to the user operation pool. The `eth_supportedEntryPoints` method provides a list of supported entry points that can be used to submit user operations. This module is used in conjunction with other modules in the Nethermind project to provide a complete Ethereum client implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountAbstractionRpcModule` class?
- The `AccountAbstractionRpcModule` class is a module for handling RPC requests related to user operations on Ethereum accounts.

2. What is the significance of the `eth_sendUserOperation` method?
- The `eth_sendUserOperation` method is used to add a user operation to an operation pool and returns a result wrapper containing the Keccak hash of the operation.

3. What is the purpose of the `eth_supportedEntryPoints` method?
- The `eth_supportedEntryPoints` method returns a result wrapper containing an array of supported entry points for user operations.
