The `VersionToMetricsTests` class is a test suite that tests the `ConvertToNumber` method of the `VersionToMetrics` class. The purpose of the `ConvertToNumber` method is to convert a version string to a version number. The version number is an integer that represents the version string in a way that can be used for comparison. The method takes a version string as input and returns a version number as output.

The `VersionToMetricsTests` class contains a series of test cases that test the `ConvertToNumber` method with different version strings. Each test case consists of a version string and the expected version number. The test cases cover a range of version string formats, including standard formats like "1.2.3" and non-standard formats like "11.22.333-prerelease+build". The test cases ensure that the `ConvertToNumber` method correctly converts all valid version string formats to version numbers.

The `ConvertToNumber` method is used in the larger Nethermind project to compare version numbers of different components. For example, the method can be used to compare the version number of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the version number of the Nethermind client. If the EVM version number is greater than the Nethermind client version number, it means that the EVM is more up-to-date and may have new features that the Nethermind client does not support. This information can be used to determine whether an upgrade is necessary.

Example usage of the `ConvertToNumber` method:

```
using Nethermind.Runner;

int evmVersionNumber = VersionToMetrics.ConvertToNumber("1.2.3");
int clientVersionNumber = VersionToMetrics.ConvertToNumber("1.1.0");

if (evmVersionNumber > clientVersionNumber)
{
    Console.WriteLine("EVM is more up-to-date than the client.");
}
else if (evmVersionNumber < clientVersionNumber)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Client is more up-to-date than the EVM.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("EVM and client are up-to-date.");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VersionToMetricsTests` class?
- The `VersionToMetricsTests` class is a test fixture that contains a series of test cases for the `ConvertToNumber` method of the `VersionToMetrics` class.

2. What is the significance of the `TestCase` attribute in the `Converts_all_formats` method?
- The `TestCase` attribute specifies the input parameters and expected output for each test case that will be executed by the `Converts_all_formats` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `Parallelizable` attribute in the `VersionToMetricsTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `VersionToMetricsTests` class can be run in parallel, which can improve the speed of test execution.
