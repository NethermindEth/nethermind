The `ChainspecFilesTests` class is a test suite for the `ChainSpecLoader` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to test the functionality of the `ChainSpecLoader` class by loading different chain specification files in different formats and verifying that the loaded chain specification has the expected chain ID. 

The `ChainspecFilesTests` class contains four test methods, each of which tests a different scenario for loading a chain specification file. The first three test methods test the `LoadEmbeddedOrFromFile` method of the `ChainSpecLoader` class by passing different formats of the chain specification file path and verifying that the loaded chain specification has the expected chain ID. The fourth test method tests the scenario where the chain specification file does not exist and verifies that the `LoadEmbeddedOrFromFile` method throws a `FileNotFoundException`.

The `ChainspecFilesTests` class uses the `FluentAssertions` and `NUnit.Framework` libraries for testing and the `NSubstitute` library for mocking the `ILogger` interface. The `EthereumJsonSerializer` class is used as the JSON serializer for the `ChainSpecLoader` class.

Here is an example of how the `LoadEmbeddedOrFromFile` method can be used to load a chain specification file:

```csharp
var jsonSerializer = new EthereumJsonSerializer();
var loader = new ChainSpecLoader(jsonSerializer);
var logger = new ConsoleLogger(LogLevel.Info);

var chainSpec = loader.LoadEmbeddedOrFromFile("foundation.json", logger);

Assert.AreEqual(1UL, chainSpec.ChainId);
```

In this example, a new instance of the `ChainSpecLoader` class is created with an instance of the `EthereumJsonSerializer` class as the JSON serializer. The `LoadEmbeddedOrFromFile` method is then called with the path to the `foundation.json` chain specification file and an instance of the `ConsoleLogger` class as the logger. The loaded chain specification is then verified to have a chain ID of 1.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains tests for loading and matching chain specifications using the `ChainSpecLoader` class.

2. What external dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file has external dependencies on `FluentAssertions`, `Nethermind.Logging`, `NUnit.Framework`, `Nethermind.Specs.ChainSpecStyle`, `Nethermind.Serialization.Json`, and `NSubstitute`.

3. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `ChainspecFilesTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute with `ParallelScope.All` value indicates that the tests in this class can be run in parallel with other test classes and with each other.
