The `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class is responsible for building a pipeline of transaction filters that can be used to validate transactions before they are included in a block. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to create a standard filtering pipeline that can be used across the Nethermind project.

The `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method is a static method that takes in a `logManager`, `specProvider`, and `blocksConfig` as parameters and returns an instance of `ITxFilterPipeline`. This method is responsible for creating a standard filtering pipeline that includes the `MinGasPriceTxFilter` and `BaseFeeTxFilter` filters. These filters are added to the pipeline using the `WithMinGasPriceFilter` and `WithBaseFeeFilter` methods respectively.

The `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class has several methods that can be used to add custom filters to the pipeline. The `WithCustomTxFilter` method can be used to add a custom filter to the pipeline. The `WithNullTxFilter` method can be used to add a filter that does nothing to the pipeline. These methods return the `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` instance to allow for method chaining.

The `Build` property returns the built pipeline as an instance of `ITxFilterPipeline`.

Overall, the `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class provides a way to create a standard filtering pipeline that can be used to validate transactions before they are included in a block. This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to ensure that all transactions are validated using the same set of filters. Below is an example of how this class can be used to create a standard filtering pipeline:

```
var logManager = new LogManager();
var specProvider = new SpecProvider();
var blocksConfig = new BlocksConfig();

var pipeline = TxFilterPipelineBuilder.CreateStandardFilteringPipeline(logManager, specProvider, blocksConfig);

// Use the pipeline to validate transactions
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class?
    
    The `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class is used to build a pipeline of transaction filters that can be applied to incoming transactions.

2. What are the parameters required to create a standard filtering pipeline using the `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method?
    
    The `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method requires an `ILogManager` instance, an `ISpecProvider` instance, and an `IBlocksConfig` instance as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `WithCustomTxFilter` method?
    
    The `WithCustomTxFilter` method is used to add a custom transaction filter to the pipeline.
