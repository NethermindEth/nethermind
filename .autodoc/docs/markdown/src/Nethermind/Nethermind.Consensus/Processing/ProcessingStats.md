The `ProcessingStats` class is responsible for collecting and updating various statistics related to the processing of blocks in the Nethermind blockchain. These statistics include gas usage, transaction count, block count, and various performance metrics such as processing time, memory usage, and garbage collection statistics.

The class is designed to be used internally within the Nethermind consensus processing module, and is not intended to be used directly by external modules or applications.

The `UpdateStats` method is called each time a block is processed, and updates the various statistics based on the properties of the block and the current state of the blockchain. The method takes a `Block` object as input, along with various other parameters related to the current state of the blockchain.

The `Start` method is called at the beginning of the processing of a block, and starts the internal stopwatch used to measure processing time.

The class is designed to be used in conjunction with a logger object, which is passed to the constructor. The logger is used to output the various statistics to the console or log file, depending on the logging configuration.

Overall, the `ProcessingStats` class provides a useful tool for monitoring the performance and health of the Nethermind blockchain, and can be used to identify and diagnose performance issues and bottlenecks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProcessingStats` class?
- The `ProcessingStats` class is used to track and update various metrics related to block processing, such as gas usage, transaction count, and memory usage.

2. What is the significance of the `#if DEBUG` preprocessor directive?
- The `#if DEBUG` directive is used to conditionally compile code only in debug builds. In this case, it sets the `_isDebugMode` field to `true` if the logger's trace level is enabled.

3. What is the purpose of the `UpdateStats` method?
- The `UpdateStats` method is called after a block has been processed and updates the various metrics tracked by the `ProcessingStats` class. It also logs the current values of these metrics if the logger's info or trace level is enabled.
