The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the consensus processing module. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to combine multiple `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances into a single step. 

The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class implements the `IBlockPreprocessorStep` interface, which defines the `RecoverData` method. This method takes a `Block` object as an argument and calls the `RecoverData` method of each `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instance in the `_recoverySteps` list. This allows the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` to execute multiple recovery steps in a single call.

The `_recoverySteps` field is a `LinkedList` of `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances. The constructor of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class takes an array of `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances as an argument and adds them to the `_recoverySteps` list. The `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods can be used to add additional `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances to the beginning or end of the list.

This class can be used in the larger project to simplify the process of recovering data from a block. Instead of calling each recovery step individually, a `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` instance can be created and used to execute all the recovery steps in a single call. This can help to reduce code duplication and make the recovery process more modular.

Example usage:

```
var step1 = new BlockPreprocessorStep1();
var step2 = new BlockPreprocessorStep2();
var compositeStep = new CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep(step1, step2);

var block = new Block();
compositeStep.RecoverData(block);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class?
   - The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class is an implementation of the `IBlockPreprocessorStep` interface and is used to execute a list of recovery steps on a given block.

2. What is the significance of the `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods?
   - The `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods are used to add recovery steps to the beginning or end of the list of recovery steps, respectively.

3. What is the expected behavior if the `recoverySteps` parameter is null in the constructor?
   - If the `recoverySteps` parameter is null in the constructor, an `ArgumentNullException` will be thrown.
