This code defines an enum called `BlockRewardType` and a static class called `BlockRewardTypeExtension`. The `BlockRewardType` enum has four possible values: `Block`, `Uncle`, `EmptyStep`, and `External`. The `BlockRewardTypeExtension` class contains a single method called `ToLowerString` that takes a `BlockRewardType` enum value as input and returns a lowercase string representation of that value.

This code is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to handle block rewards in the consensus mechanism. The `BlockRewardType` enum likely represents the different types of rewards that can be given out for different types of blocks or block-related events. The `BlockRewardTypeExtension` class provides a convenient way to convert these enum values to lowercase strings, which may be useful for logging or other purposes.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Consensus.Rewards;

// ...

BlockRewardType rewardType = BlockRewardType.Block;
string rewardTypeString = rewardType.ToLowerString();
Console.WriteLine($"Reward type: {rewardTypeString}"); // Output: "Reward type: block"
```

In this example, we create a `BlockRewardType` enum value and then use the `ToLowerString` method to convert it to a lowercase string. We then print out the resulting string to the console. This would output "Reward type: block".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockRewardType` enum?
   - The `BlockRewardType` enum is used to represent different types of block rewards in the Nethermind project.
2. What is the `BlockRewardTypeExtension` class used for?
   - The `BlockRewardTypeExtension` class provides an extension method `ToLowerString` to convert a `BlockRewardType` enum value to its corresponding lowercase string representation.
3. What license is this code released under?
