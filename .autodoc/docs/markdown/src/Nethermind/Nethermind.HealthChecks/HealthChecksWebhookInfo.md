The `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class is a part of the Nethermind project and provides useful information in health checks' webhook notifications. This class is used to create an object that contains information about the health of the node. The object contains the description of the node, the IP address of the node, the hostname of the node, and the name of the node. 

The constructor of the `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class takes four parameters: `description`, `ipResolver`, `metricsConfig`, and `hostname`. The `description` parameter is a string that describes the node. The `ipResolver` parameter is an interface that resolves the IP address of the node. The `metricsConfig` parameter is an interface that provides the configuration of the metrics. The `hostname` parameter is a string that contains the hostname of the node.

The `GetFullInfo` method returns a string that contains the full information about the node. The string contains the description of the node, the name of the node, the hostname of the node, and the IP address of the node. The information is formatted as a string that can be easily read by humans. 

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the health of the node. The information provided by this class can be used to monitor the health of the node and to take corrective actions if necessary. For example, if the IP address of the node changes, the information provided by this class can be used to update the monitoring system. 

Here is an example of how to use the `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class:

```
var ipResolver = new IPResolver();
var metricsConfig = new MetricsConfig();
var hostname = "myhostname";
var description = "mydescription";
var healthChecksWebhookInfo = new HealthChecksWebhookInfo(description, ipResolver, metricsConfig, hostname);
var fullInfo = healthChecksWebhookInfo.GetFullInfo();
Console.WriteLine(fullInfo);
```

This code creates an object of the `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class and calls the `GetFullInfo` method to get the full information about the node. The information is then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` that provides information for health checks' webhook notifications, including the node name, hostname, and external IP address.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind.Monitoring.Metrics`, `Nethermind.Monitoring.Config`, and `Nethermind.Network` namespaces, as well as the `System.Net` and `System` namespaces.

3. How is the external IP address determined?
   - The external IP address is determined using an `IIPResolver` object passed in as a parameter to the constructor of `HealthChecksWebhookInfo`. The `ExternalIp` property of the `IIPResolver` object is used to get the external IP address as an `IPAddress` object, which is then converted to a string and stored in the `_ip` field.
