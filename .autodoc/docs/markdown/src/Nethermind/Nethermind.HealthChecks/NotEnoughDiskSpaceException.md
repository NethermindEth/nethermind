[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.HealthChecks/NotEnoughDiskSpaceException.cs)

This code defines a custom exception class called `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` that inherits from the base `Exception` class and implements the `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface. The purpose of this exception is to be thrown when there is not enough disk space available for the Nethermind project to operate properly.

The `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface is used to specify an exit code that can be returned when this exception is caught. In this case, the `ExitCode` property is set to `ExitCodes.LowDiskSpace`, which is a constant defined in the `Nethermind.Config` namespace. This exit code can be used to provide more information to the user or to trigger specific actions in the larger Nethermind project.

This code is important because it helps to ensure that the Nethermind project can handle low disk space situations in a consistent and predictable way. By defining a custom exception class and implementing the `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface, developers can easily catch and handle this exception in a way that makes sense for their specific use case.

Here is an example of how this exception might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```csharp
try
{
    // Perform some operation that requires disk space
}
catch (NotEnoughDiskSpaceException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Not enough disk space available.");
    Console.WriteLine($"Exit code: {ex.ExitCode}");
    // Take appropriate action based on the exit code
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred.");
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

In this example, the `try` block contains some operation that requires disk space. If there is not enough disk space available, a `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` is thrown. The `catch` block for this exception prints an error message and the exit code, which can be used to trigger specific actions in the larger Nethermind project. The `catch` block for all other exceptions prints a generic error message.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a custom exception class called `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` that implements the `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
- The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the role of the `ExitCode` property in the `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` class?
- The `ExitCode` property returns the exit code that should be used when the exception is thrown. In this case, the exit code is `ExitCodes.LowDiskSpace`, which likely indicates that there is not enough disk space available for the application to function properly.
