The `JsonRpcUrlCollectionTests` class is a set of unit tests for the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class in the Nethermind project. The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is responsible for managing a collection of JSON-RPC URLs that the Nethermind client can use to connect to Ethereum nodes. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is correctly handling various scenarios for configuring and adding URLs to the collection.

The tests cover a range of scenarios, including adding default URLs, overriding default URLs with environment variables, adding additional URLs, and specifying engine URLs. The tests use the `JsonRpcConfig` class to configure the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` instance with various settings, such as which modules are enabled, which ports to use, and which URLs to add.

Each test creates a new instance of the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class and asserts that the collection contains the expected URLs. The tests use the `CollectionAssert` class to compare the expected URLs with the actual URLs in the collection.

For example, the `Contains_single_default_url` test asserts that the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` instance contains a single URL with the default settings. The expected URL is created using the `JsonRpcUrl` class, which takes the protocol, host, port, endpoint, and enabled modules as parameters. The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` instance is then created with the `JsonRpcConfig` and `ILogManager` instances, and the `CollectionAssert` class is used to compare the expected and actual URLs.

Overall, these tests ensure that the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is correctly handling the configuration and management of JSON-RPC URLs, which is an important part of the Nethermind client's functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class?
- The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is used to manage a collection of JSON-RPC URLs for different modules.

2. What is the significance of the `EnabledModules` property?
- The `EnabledModules` property is used to specify which JSON-RPC modules are enabled for the URL collection.

3. What is the purpose of the `EngineHost` and `EnginePort` properties?
- The `EngineHost` and `EnginePort` properties are used to specify the host and port for a JSON-RPC engine, which is a special module that can be used to interact with the Nethermind client's internal state.
