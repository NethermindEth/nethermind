The `JsonRpcServiceTests` class contains a series of unit tests for the `JsonRpcService` class, which is responsible for handling JSON-RPC requests and responses. The tests cover various scenarios, such as testing the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method, testing the handling of optional arguments, and testing the case sensitivity of method names.

The `JsonRpcService` class is part of the larger Nethermind project, which is an Ethereum client implementation written in C#. The `JsonRpcService` class is responsible for handling JSON-RPC requests and responses, which are used to communicate with Ethereum nodes. JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON, and it is used to interact with Ethereum nodes over HTTP or IPC.

The `JsonRpcServiceTests` class uses the `NUnit` testing framework to test the `JsonRpcService` class. The tests use the `Substitute` library to create mock objects for the `IEthRpcModule`, `INetRpcModule`, and `IWeb3RpcModule` interfaces, which are used to represent the Ethereum, network, and web3 modules, respectively. The tests also use the `FluentAssertions` library to provide more readable assertions.

The `JsonRpcServiceTests` class contains several test methods, each of which tests a specific scenario. The `TestRequest` method is used to test a JSON-RPC request by creating a `JsonRpcService` instance and sending a request to it. The `TestRequest` method takes a module, a method name, and an array of parameters as arguments, and it returns a `JsonRpcResponse` object.

The `GetBlockByNumberTest` method tests the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method by creating a mock `IEthRpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected block number.

The `Eth_module_populates_size_when_returning_block_data` method tests that the `BlockForRpc` object returned by the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method contains the correct `Size` property.

The `CanHandleOptionalArguments` method tests that the `eth_call` method can handle optional arguments by creating a mock `IEthRpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected result.

The `Case_sensitivity_test` method tests that the `JsonRpcService` class is case-insensitive when handling method names.

The `GetNewFilterTest` method tests the `eth_newFilter` method by creating a mock `IEthRpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected result.

The `Eth_call_is_working_with_implicit_null_as_the_last_argument` method tests that the `eth_call` method can handle an implicit null value as the last argument.

The `Eth_call_is_working_with_explicit_null_as_the_last_argument` method tests that the `eth_call` method can handle an explicit null value as the last argument.

The `GetWorkTest` method tests the `eth_getWork` method by creating a mock `IEthRpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected result.

The `IncorrectMethodNameTest` method tests that the `JsonRpcService` class returns an error response when an incorrect method name is used.

The `NetVersionTest` method tests the `net_version` method by creating a mock `INetRpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected result.

The `Web3ShaTest` method tests the `web3_sha3` method by creating a mock `IWeb3RpcModule` object and setting up a response for it. The method then sends a JSON-RPC request to the `JsonRpcService` instance and checks the response to ensure that it contains the expected result.

The `BlockForRpc_should_expose_withdrawals_if_any` method tests that the `BlockForRpc` object returned by the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method contains the correct `Withdrawals` and `WithdrawalsRoot` properties.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains unit tests for the `JsonRpcService` class in the `Nethermind.JsonRpc` namespace.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
