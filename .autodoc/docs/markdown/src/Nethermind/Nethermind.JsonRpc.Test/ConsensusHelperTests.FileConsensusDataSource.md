This code defines a class called `FileConsensusDataSource` that implements the `IConsensusDataSource` interface and is used to read consensus data from a file. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to read consensus data from a file and deserialize it into an object of type `T`. 

The `FileConsensusDataSource` class takes two parameters in its constructor: a `Uri` object representing the file to read from, and an `IJsonSerializer` object used to deserialize the JSON data in the file. The `GetData` method reads the JSON data from the file using the `GetJsonData` method, deserializes it into an object of type `T` using the provided `IJsonSerializer`, and returns a tuple containing the deserialized object and the original JSON data as a string. The `GetJsonData` method simply reads the contents of the file as a string using the `File.ReadAllTextAsync` method. 

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way to read consensus data from a file. It can be used in tests or other parts of the project that require consensus data to be read from a file. An example usage of this class might look like this:

```
var fileUri = new Uri("path/to/file.json");
var serializer = new JsonSerializer();
var dataSource = new FileConsensusDataSource<MyConsensusData>(fileUri, serializer);
var (data, jsonData) = await dataSource.GetData();
```

In this example, `MyConsensusData` is the type of object that the JSON data in the file should be deserialized into. The `GetData` method is called to read the data from the file and deserialize it into an object of type `MyConsensusData`. The resulting object and the original JSON data are returned as a tuple.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file contains a class called `FileConsensusDataSource` which implements the `IConsensusDataSource` interface and is used to read data from a JSON file.

2. What is the significance of the `Uri` parameter in the `FileConsensusDataSource` constructor?
   - The `Uri` parameter specifies the location of the JSON file that the `FileConsensusDataSource` will read data from.

3. What is the purpose of the `IJsonSerializer` parameter in the `FileConsensusDataSource` constructor?
   - The `IJsonSerializer` parameter specifies the JSON serializer that will be used to deserialize the JSON data read from the file into an object of type `T`.
