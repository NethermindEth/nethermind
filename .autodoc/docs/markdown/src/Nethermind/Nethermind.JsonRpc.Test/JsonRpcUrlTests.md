The `JsonRpcUrlTests` class is a unit test class that tests the `JsonRpcUrl` class. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is responsible for parsing and validating JSON-RPC URLs. JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON. It is a lightweight protocol that allows clients to call methods on a server. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used in the Nethermind project to parse and validate JSON-RPC URLs that are used to connect to Ethereum nodes.

The `JsonRpcUrlTests` class contains two test methods: `Parse_success` and `Parse_fail`. The `Parse_success` method tests the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method with valid input. It takes a packed URL value, expected scheme, expected host, expected port, expected RPC endpoint, and expected enabled modules as input. It then calls the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method with the packed URL value and asserts that the parsed URL has the expected scheme, host, port, RPC endpoint, and enabled modules. The `Parse_fail` method tests the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method with invalid input. It takes a packed URL value and an expected exception type as input. It then calls the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method with the packed URL value and asserts that the expected exception is thrown.

The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used in the Nethermind project to parse and validate JSON-RPC URLs. It is used in the `JsonRpcConfig` class to parse the `JsonRpcUrls` configuration value. The `JsonRpcConfig` class is responsible for configuring the JSON-RPC server. It is used in the `JsonRpcServer` class to start the JSON-RPC server. The `JsonRpcServer` class is responsible for handling JSON-RPC requests. It is used in the `Node` class to start the Ethereum node. The `Node` class is the main class of the Nethermind project. It is responsible for starting and stopping the Ethereum node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrl` class and its `Parse` method?
- The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used to represent a JSON-RPC endpoint URL and its associated enabled modules. The `Parse` method is used to parse a packed URL string into a `JsonRpcUrl` instance.
2. What are the different test cases being covered in the `Parse_success` method?
- The `Parse_success` method tests the `Parse` method with different packed URL strings and verifies that the resulting `JsonRpcUrl` instance has the expected properties, such as the scheme, host, port, enabled modules, and RPC endpoint type.
3. What are the different test cases being covered in the `Parse_fail` method?
- The `Parse_fail` method tests the `Parse` method with invalid packed URL strings and verifies that the expected exception type is thrown. The invalid cases include missing or invalid scheme, host, port, enabled modules, or RPC endpoint type.
