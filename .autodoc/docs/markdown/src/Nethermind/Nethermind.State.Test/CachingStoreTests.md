The `CachingStoreTests` class is a test suite for the `CachingStore` class in the Nethermind project. The `CachingStore` class is responsible for caching key-value pairs in memory, backed by a persistent store. This class is used to improve the performance of database reads and writes by reducing the number of disk accesses required.

The `CachingStoreTests` class contains four test methods that test the behavior of the `CachingStore` class under different scenarios. The first test method, `When_setting_values_stores_them_in_the_cache`, tests whether the `CachingStore` class stores values in the cache when they are set. The test creates a new `Context` object with a cache size of 2, sets a value in the cache, reads the value from the cache, and then writes another value to the cache. The test then asserts that the first value is still in the cache and that the second value has been evicted from the cache.

The second test method, `When_reading_values_stores_them_in_the_cache`, tests whether the `CachingStore` class stores values in the cache when they are read. The test creates a new `Context` object with a cache size of 2, sets a read function that always returns a value of `Value1`, reads the value from the cache twice, and then asserts that the value is still in the cache.

The third test method, `Uses_lru_strategy_when_caching_on_reads`, tests whether the `CachingStore` class uses a least-recently-used (LRU) eviction strategy when caching values on reads. The test creates a new `Context` object with a cache size of 2, sets a read function that always returns a value of `Value1`, reads three values from the cache in a specific order, and then asserts that the least-recently-used value has been evicted from the cache.

The fourth test method, `Uses_lru_strategy_when_caching_on_writes`, tests whether the `CachingStore` class uses a least-recently-used (LRU) eviction strategy when caching values on writes. The test creates a new `Context` object with a cache size of 2, sets a read function that always returns a value of `Value1`, writes three values to the cache in a specific order, and then asserts that the least-recently-used value has been evicted from the cache.

Overall, the `CachingStoreTests` class tests the behavior of the `CachingStore` class in different scenarios to ensure that it correctly caches key-value pairs in memory and evicts them according to an LRU strategy. These tests help ensure that the `CachingStore` class is working correctly and can be used effectively in the larger Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CachingStore` class?
- The `CachingStore` class is used to cache read and write operations on a `TestMemDb` instance.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `CachingStoreTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `CachingStoreTests` class can be run in parallel.

3. What is the purpose of the `KeyWasRead` and `KeyWasWritten` methods called in the test methods?
- The `KeyWasRead` and `KeyWasWritten` methods are used to simulate read and write operations on the `TestMemDb` instance, which is wrapped by the `CachingStore` instance being tested.
