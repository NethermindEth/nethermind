The `WorldStateTests` class is a test suite for the `WorldState` class in the Nethermind project. The `WorldState` class is responsible for managing the state and storage of the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `WorldState` class is functioning correctly.

The first test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_invokes_take_snapshot_on_both_providers()`, tests that when a snapshot is taken, the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on both the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` objects. This is important because the `WorldState` class relies on these providers to manage the state and storage of the blockchain.

The second test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_return_the_same_value_as_both()`, tests that when a snapshot is taken, the `Snapshot` object returned by the `TakeSnapshot()` method has the same values for `StateSnapshot` and `PersistentStorageSnapshot` as the `Snapshot` objects returned by the `TakeSnapshot()` methods of the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` objects, respectively. This is important because it ensures that the `WorldState` class is correctly managing the state and storage of the blockchain.

The third test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_return_non_zero_snapshot_value()`, tests that when a snapshot is taken, the `Snapshot` object returned by the `TakeSnapshot()` method has the correct values for `StateSnapshot`, `PersistentStorageSnapshot`, and `TransientStorageSnapshot`. This is important because it ensures that the `WorldState` class is correctly managing the state and storage of the blockchain.

The fourth test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_specify_transaction_boundary()`, tests that when a snapshot is taken with a transaction boundary, the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on the `IStorageProvider` object with the `true` parameter. This is important because it ensures that the `WorldState` class is correctly managing the storage of the blockchain.

The fifth test, `Can_restore_snapshot()`, tests that when a snapshot is restored, the `Restore()` method is called on both the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` objects with the correct parameters. This is important because it ensures that the `WorldState` class is correctly managing the state and storage of the blockchain.

Overall, this test suite is important for ensuring that the `WorldState` class is functioning correctly and that the state and storage of the blockchain are being managed correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WorldState` class?
- The `WorldState` class is used to take and restore snapshots of the state and storage providers.

2. What is the significance of the `FluentAssertions` and `NSubstitute` namespaces being used?
- The `FluentAssertions` namespace is used for fluent assertion syntax in the tests, while the `NSubstitute` namespace is used for creating test doubles (substitutes) of the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` interfaces.

3. What is the purpose of the `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_specify_transaction_boundary` test?
- The `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_specify_transaction_boundary` test checks if the `TakeSnapshot` method can specify a transaction boundary by verifying that the `TakeSnapshot` method of the `IStorageProvider` interface is called with the `true` parameter.
