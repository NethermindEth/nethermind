The `EthereumStepsLoader` class is responsible for loading and selecting the appropriate implementation of the `IStep` interface based on the provided `INethermindApi` implementation. 

The class takes in one or more assemblies containing the `IStep` implementations as a constructor parameter. It then provides a `LoadSteps` method that takes in an `apiType` parameter, which is the implementation of the `INethermindApi` interface. The method first checks if the provided `apiType` implements the `INethermindApi` interface. If not, it throws a `NotSupportedException`.

The method then searches through all the provided assemblies for types that implement the `IStep` interface and are not abstract or interfaces. It then groups these types by their base type, which is the first non-abstract type in their inheritance hierarchy that implements the `IStep` interface. 

For each group of `IStep` implementations with the same base type, the method selects the implementation that has a constructor that takes in the provided `apiType` as a parameter. If no implementation has such a constructor, it selects the implementation that has a constructor that takes in the `INethermindApi` interface as a parameter. If there are multiple implementations that match, it selects the one that is assignable from the others.

The method returns the selected `IStep` implementation as a `StepInfo` object, which contains the implementation type and its base type.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to dynamically load and select the appropriate `IStep` implementation based on the provided `INethermindApi` implementation. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in the project, as new `IStep` implementations can be added without needing to modify the code that uses them. 

Example usage:

```csharp
// create an instance of the EthereumStepsLoader with the assembly containing the IStep implementations
var loader = new EthereumStepsLoader(typeof(MyNethermindApi).Assembly);

// load the appropriate IStep implementation for the provided INethermindApi implementation
var stepInfo = loader.LoadSteps(typeof(MyNethermindApi)).FirstOrDefault();

// create an instance of the selected IStep implementation
var step = (IStep)Activator.CreateInstance(stepInfo.StepType, myNethermindApiInstance);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EthereumStepsLoader` class?
- The `EthereumStepsLoader` class is responsible for loading and selecting the appropriate implementation of `IStep` for a given `INethermindApi` implementation.

2. What is the significance of the `params` keyword in the constructor?
- The `params` keyword allows the constructor to accept a variable number of arguments of type `Assembly`, which are then passed as an `IEnumerable<Assembly>` to the other constructor.

3. What is the purpose of the `SelectImplementation` method?
- The `SelectImplementation` method selects the appropriate implementation of `IStep` for a given `INethermindApi` implementation, based on the constructor parameters of the available implementations.
