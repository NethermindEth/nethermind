The `MigrateConfigs` class is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind node. It is responsible for migrating the configuration settings from the previous version of the node to the current one. The class implements the `IStep` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Execute` method. This method is called during the initialization process and is responsible for executing the migration of the configuration settings.

The `MigrateConfigs` class has two private fields: `_api` of type `INethermindApi` and `_logger` of type `ILogger`. The `_api` field is used to access the configuration settings of the node, while the `_logger` field is used for logging.

The `Execute` method first retrieves the `IMiningConfig` and `IReceiptConfig` instances from the `_api` field. It then calls the `MigrateInitConfig` method to migrate the initialization configuration settings. Finally, it calls the `MigrateBlocksConfig` method to migrate the block configuration settings.

The `MigrateInitConfig` method is responsible for migrating the initialization configuration settings. It retrieves the `IInitConfig` instance from the `_api` field and checks its properties to determine which settings need to be migrated. If the `IsMining` property is `true`, it sets the `Enabled` property of the `IMiningConfig` instance to `true`. If the `StoreReceipts` property is `false`, it sets the `StoreReceipts` property of the `IReceiptConfig` instance to `false`. If the `ReceiptsMigration` property is `true`, it sets the `ReceiptsMigration` property of the `IReceiptConfig` instance to `true`.

The `MigrateBlocksConfig` method is responsible for migrating the block configuration settings. It takes two parameters of type `IBlocksConfig?`. The method is marked as `public` and `static` so that it can be used in tests. The method retrieves the properties of the `IBlocksConfig` instance and loops over them to check for mismatches between the previous and current versions of the node. If a mismatch is found, the method changes the default value of the property to match the current version of the node.

Overall, the `MigrateConfigs` class is an important step in the initialization process of the Nethermind node. It ensures that the configuration settings are migrated correctly from the previous version of the node to the current one. The `MigrateInitConfig` method migrates the initialization configuration settings, while the `MigrateBlocksConfig` method migrates the block configuration settings.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MigrateConfigs` class?
- The `MigrateConfigs` class is an implementation of the `IStep` interface and is responsible for migrating the configuration settings of the Nethermind node.

2. What is the purpose of the `MigrateBlocksConfig` method?
- The `MigrateBlocksConfig` method is used to loop over the configuration properties and check for mismatches and changing defaults so that on given and current inner configs, only the same values are present.

3. Why is the `MigrateBlocksConfig` method marked as public and static?
- The `MigrateBlocksConfig` method is marked as public and static for use in tests.
