The `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project. It updates the discovery configuration of the node based on the chain specification and bootnodes. 

The class implements the `IStep` interface and has a single public method `Execute` that takes a `CancellationToken` and returns a `Task`. The `Execute` method calls the private `Update` method and returns a completed task. 

The `Update` method first checks if the `ChainSpec` property of the `INethermindApi` instance is not null. If it is null, the method returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it retrieves the `IDiscoveryConfig` instance from the `INethermindApi` instance and checks if the `Bootnodes` property is not empty. If it is not empty, the method appends the chain specification bootnodes to the existing bootnodes. If the `Bootnodes` property is empty, the method sets it to the chain specification bootnodes. 

The `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class has a single constructor that takes an `INethermindApi` instance as a parameter. The `INethermindApi` instance is used to retrieve the chain specification and discovery configuration. 

This class is dependent on the `FilterBootnodes` class, which is specified using the `RunnerStepDependencies` attribute. This means that the `FilterBootnodes` class must be executed before the `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class. 

Overall, the `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class is responsible for updating the discovery configuration of the node based on the chain specification and bootnodes. It is an important step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project and ensures that the node can discover and connect to other nodes on the network. 

Example usage:

```
INethermindApi api = new NethermindApi();
UpdateDiscoveryConfig updateDiscoveryConfig = new UpdateDiscoveryConfig(api);
await updateDiscoveryConfig.Execute(CancellationToken.None);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project that updates the discovery configuration with bootnodes specified in the chain specification.

2. What is the significance of the `[RunnerStepDependencies(typeof(FilterBootnodes))]` attribute?
   
   The `[RunnerStepDependencies(typeof(FilterBootnodes))]` attribute indicates that this step depends on the `FilterBootnodes` step to be executed before it can run.

3. What is the role of the `INethermindApi` interface and how is it being used in this code?
   
   The `INethermindApi` interface is being used to access the configuration and chain specification of the Nethermind node. It is being injected into the constructor of the `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class and used to update the discovery configuration with the bootnodes specified in the chain specification.
