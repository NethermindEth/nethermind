The `FilterBootnodes` class is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project. It is responsible for filtering out bootnodes that have the same NodeId as the current node. Bootnodes are nodes that are used to bootstrap the network when a node starts up. 

The class implements the `IStep` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Execute` method. The method takes a `CancellationToken` parameter, which is not used in this implementation. The method first checks if the `ChainSpec` property of the `_api` field is null. If it is null, the method returns a completed task. If it is not null, the method checks if the `NodeKey` property of the `_api` field is null. If it is null, the method returns a completed task. 

If both `ChainSpec` and `NodeKey` are not null, the method filters out bootnodes that have the same NodeId as the current node. This is done by using LINQ to filter the `Bootnodes` property of the `ChainSpec` object. The `Where` method is used to filter out nodes that have a `NodeId` property that is equal to the `PublicKey` property of the `NodeKey` object. The `ToArray` method is then called to convert the filtered `Bootnodes` collection to an array. If the `Bootnodes` property is null, an empty array is returned. 

The `FilterBootnodes` class has a single constructor that takes an `INethermindApi` object as a parameter. The constructor initializes the `_api` field with the provided object. The class also has a `RunnerStepDependencies` attribute that specifies that this step depends on the `SetupKeyStore` step. 

Overall, the `FilterBootnodes` class is an important step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project. It ensures that bootnodes with the same NodeId as the current node are filtered out, which helps to prevent network issues and improve the stability of the network. 

Example usage:

```
INethermindApi api = new NethermindApi();
FilterBootnodes filterBootnodes = new FilterBootnodes(api);
await filterBootnodes.Execute(CancellationToken.None);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file is a part of the Nethermind project and it filters bootnodes based on the public key of the node.

2. What is the significance of the `[RunnerStepDependencies(typeof(SetupKeyStore))]` attribute?
   - This attribute specifies that this step depends on the `SetupKeyStore` step and should be executed after it.

3. What is the role of the `Execute` method in this code file?
   - The `Execute` method is the main method of this step and it filters the bootnodes based on the public key of the node. It returns a completed task when the execution is finished.
