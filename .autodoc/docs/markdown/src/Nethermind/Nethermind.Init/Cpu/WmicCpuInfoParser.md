The `WmicCpuInfoParser` class is responsible for parsing the output of the `wmic cpu` command and returning a `CpuInfo` object. The `ParseOutput` method takes a string as input, which is the output of the `wmic cpu` command, and returns a `CpuInfo` object.

The `ParseOutput` method first calls the `ParseSections` method of the `SectionsHelper` class to parse the output of the `wmic cpu` command into sections. Each section represents a processor on the system.

The method then iterates over each processor section and extracts the following information:

- The number of physical cores by summing up the `NumberOfCores` property of each processor section.
- The number of logical cores by summing up the `NumberOfLogicalProcessors` property of each processor section.
- The processor model names by adding the `Name` property of each processor section to a `HashSet<string>`.
- The maximum clock speed by summing up the `MaxClockSpeed` property of each processor section.

The method then creates a new `CpuInfo` object with the extracted information and returns it.

The `CpuInfo` object contains the following information:

- The processor model names as a comma-separated string.
- The number of processors.
- The number of physical cores.
- The number of logical cores.
- The current clock speed as an average of all processors.
- The minimum clock speed as an average of all processors.
- The maximum clock speed as an average of all processors.

This class is used in the larger project to gather information about the CPU of the system running the Nethermind software. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the software based on the capabilities of the CPU. For example, the number of threads used by the software can be adjusted based on the number of logical cores available on the CPU.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WmicCpuInfoParser` class?
    
    The `WmicCpuInfoParser` class is used to parse CPU information from a string output.

2. What is the `CpuInfo` class and what information does it contain?
    
    The `CpuInfo` class contains information about the CPU, including the processor model names, number of processors, physical and logical core counts, and clock speeds.

3. What is the source of the `SectionsHelper` class used in this code?
    
    The `SectionsHelper` class is derived from the `BenchmarkDotNet` project on GitHub and is licensed under the MIT License.
