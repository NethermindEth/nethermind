[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Init/Cpu/ProcCpuInfoKeyNames.cs)

This code defines a static class called `ProcCpuInfoKeyNames` that contains several constant strings representing key names for various CPU information. The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for accessing these key names throughout the larger project.

The `PhysicalId` key represents the physical ID of the CPU, which can be useful for identifying the specific hardware being used. The `CpuCores` key represents the number of CPU cores available on the system. The `ModelName` key represents the name of the CPU model. The `MaxFrequency` and `MinFrequency` keys represent the maximum and minimum frequencies of the CPU, respectively.

By defining these key names in a centralized location, other parts of the project can easily reference them without having to hard-code the strings themselves. This can help to reduce errors and make the code more maintainable.

For example, if another part of the project needed to retrieve the number of CPU cores, it could simply reference the `CpuCores` constant from the `ProcCpuInfoKeyNames` class, like so:

```
int cpuCores = GetCpuInfoValue(ProcCpuInfoKeyNames.CpuCores);
```

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger Nethermind project, helping to improve code organization and maintainability.
