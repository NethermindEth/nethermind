The `P2PProtocolInfoProvider` class is a utility class that provides two static methods for retrieving information about the P2P protocol used in the Nethermind project. The class is located in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P` namespace and is part of the larger Nethermind project.

The first method, `GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol()`, returns the highest version number of the Ethereum protocol that is supported by the Nethermind client. The method iterates over the default capabilities of the `P2PProtocolHandler` class, which is a collection of `Capability` objects that represent the various protocols supported by the client. For each `Capability` object that represents the Ethereum protocol, the method checks if its version number is higher than the current highest version number. If it is, the method updates the highest version number to the new value. Finally, the method returns the highest version number found.

Here is an example of how to use the `GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol()` method:

```
int highestVersion = P2PProtocolInfoProvider.GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol();
Console.WriteLine($"The highest version of the Ethereum protocol supported by Nethermind is {highestVersion}");
```

The second method, `DefaultCapabilitiesToString()`, returns a string representation of the default capabilities of the `P2PProtocolHandler` class. The method first orders the capabilities by protocol code and then by version number in descending order. It then selects the protocol code and version number of each capability and concatenates them into a comma-separated string.

Here is an example of how to use the `DefaultCapabilitiesToString()` method:

```
string capabilitiesString = P2PProtocolInfoProvider.DefaultCapabilitiesToString();
Console.WriteLine($"The default capabilities of the Nethermind P2P protocol handler are: {capabilitiesString}");
```

Overall, the `P2PProtocolInfoProvider` class provides convenient methods for retrieving information about the P2P protocol used in the Nethermind project. These methods can be used by other parts of the project to determine the highest version of the Ethereum protocol supported by the client or to obtain a string representation of the default capabilities of the P2P protocol handler.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file provides utility functions for retrieving information about the P2P protocol used in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol` method?
    
    The `GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol` method returns the highest version number of the Eth protocol supported by the Nethermind P2P protocol handler.

3. What is the purpose of the `DefaultCapabilitiesToString` method?
    
    The `DefaultCapabilitiesToString` method returns a string representation of the default capabilities of the Nethermind P2P protocol handler, sorted by protocol code and version number.
