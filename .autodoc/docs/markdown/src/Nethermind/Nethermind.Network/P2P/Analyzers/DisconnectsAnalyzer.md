The `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class is a tool for diagnosing network disconnections in the Nethermind project. It is designed to keep track of the reasons for disconnections and report them to the user. 

The class uses two concurrent dictionaries to store the number of disconnections for each category. The `DisconnectCategory` struct is used as the key for the dictionaries and contains two properties: `Reason` and `Type`. The `Reason` property is an enum that represents the reason for the disconnection, while the `Type` property is another enum that represents the type of disconnection. 

The class has a timer that is set to 10 seconds by default. When the timer elapses, the class creates a local copy of the current dictionary and switches to the other dictionary. It then clears the local copy and logs the results to the console. 

The `ReportDisconnect` method is used to report a new disconnection. It increments the `_disconnectCount` field and adds the disconnection to the current dictionary. If the disconnection type is `Local`, it also logs the details of the disconnection as a warning. 

The `WithIntervalOverride` method can be used to override the default timer interval. 

Overall, the `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class is a useful tool for diagnosing network disconnections in the Nethermind project. It provides a way to keep track of the reasons for disconnections and report them to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class?
    
    The `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class is created to help diagnose network disconnections.

2. What is the significance of the `DisconnectCategory` struct?
    
    The `DisconnectCategory` struct is used to categorize network disconnections based on their reason and type.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReportDisconnect` method?
    
    The `ReportDisconnect` method is used to report a network disconnection along with its reason, type, and optional details. It also increments the disconnect count and updates the disconnects dictionary. If the type is `Local` and details are provided, it logs a warning message.
