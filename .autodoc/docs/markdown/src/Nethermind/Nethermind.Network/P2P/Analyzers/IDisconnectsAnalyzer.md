This code defines an interface called `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` that is used in the Nethermind project to analyze and report disconnections in the P2P network. The P2P network is a decentralized network used for communication between nodes in the Ethereum blockchain. 

The `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` interface has a single method called `ReportDisconnect` that takes three parameters: `reason`, `type`, and `details`. The `reason` parameter is an enum of type `DisconnectReason` that represents the reason for the disconnection, such as a timeout or a protocol error. The `type` parameter is an enum of type `DisconnectType` that represents the type of disconnection, such as a voluntary or involuntary disconnection. The `details` parameter is a string that provides additional details about the disconnection.

This interface is used by other classes in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Analyzers` namespace to report disconnections in the P2P network. For example, a class that implements this interface could be used to monitor the P2P network for disconnections and report them to a monitoring system or log file. 

Here is an example of how this interface could be used in a class that implements it:

```
using Nethermind.Stats.Model;
using Nethermind.Network.P2P.Analyzers;

public class MyDisconnectsAnalyzer : IDisconnectsAnalyzer
{
    public void ReportDisconnect(DisconnectReason reason, DisconnectType type, string details)
    {
        // Do something with the disconnect information, such as log it or report it to a monitoring system
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyDisconnectsAnalyzer` is a class that implements the `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` interface. It overrides the `ReportDisconnect` method to perform some action with the disconnect information, such as logging it or reporting it to a monitoring system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines an interface called `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Analyzers` namespace, which has a method to report disconnections with a reason, type, and details.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the `DisconnectReason` and `DisconnectType` used for in the `ReportDisconnect` method?
   - The `DisconnectReason` and `DisconnectType` parameters in the `ReportDisconnect` method are used to provide information about the reason and type of disconnection that occurred. The `string details` parameter can be used to provide additional details about the disconnection.
