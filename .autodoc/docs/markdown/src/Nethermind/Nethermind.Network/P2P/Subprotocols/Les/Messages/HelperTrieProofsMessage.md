The code defines a class called `HelperTrieProofsMessage` that represents a message used in the Nethermind project's P2P subprotocol called LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol). The purpose of this message is to provide proof nodes and auxiliary data for a trie (a data structure used in Ethereum to store key-value pairs) to a requesting node. 

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. `PacketType` is an integer that identifies the type of message, and in this case, it is set to `LesMessageCode.HelperTrieProofs`. `Protocol` is a string that identifies the subprotocol, and in this case, it is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`.

The class has four public fields: `RequestId`, `BufferValue`, `ProofNodes`, and `AuxiliaryData`. `RequestId` is a long integer that identifies the request for which the proof nodes and auxiliary data are being provided. `BufferValue` is an integer that represents the buffer size used for the proof nodes. `ProofNodes` is an array of byte arrays that contains the proof nodes for the trie. `AuxiliaryData` is also an array of byte arrays that contains the auxiliary data for the trie.

The class has two constructors. The first one is empty, and the second one takes four parameters: `proofNodes`, `auxiliaryData`, `requestId`, and `bufferValue`. These parameters are used to initialize the corresponding fields of the class.

This class is used in the LES subprotocol to provide proof nodes and auxiliary data for a trie to a requesting node. The requesting node sends a request message with a `RequestId`, and the responding node sends a `HelperTrieProofsMessage` with the same `RequestId` and the corresponding proof nodes and auxiliary data. The requesting node can then use this information to verify the contents of the trie. 

Example usage:

```
// create a request message
var requestId = 12345L;
var requestMessage = new HelperTrieRequestMessage(requestId);

// send the request message to a node

// receive the response message from the node
var proofNodes = new byte[][] { /* proof nodes */ };
var auxiliaryData = new byte[][] { /* auxiliary data */ };
var bufferValue = 1024;
var responseMessage = new HelperTrieProofsMessage(proofNodes, auxiliaryData, requestId, bufferValue);

// use the proof nodes and auxiliary data to verify the contents of the trie
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HelperTrieProofsMessage` class?
    
    The `HelperTrieProofsMessage` class is a subclass of `P2PMessage` and represents a message used in the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind network for exchanging trie proofs.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?

    The `PacketType` property specifies the type of message being sent, in this case `HelperTrieProofs`, while the `Protocol` property specifies the subprotocol being used, in this case `Les`.

3. What is the purpose of the `proofNodes` and `auxiliaryData` parameters in the constructor?

    The `proofNodes` parameter is an array of trie nodes that are used to prove the existence or non-existence of a key-value pair in a trie, while the `auxiliaryData` parameter is an array of additional data that can be used to verify the trie proof. These parameters are used to initialize the corresponding properties of the `HelperTrieProofsMessage` instance.
