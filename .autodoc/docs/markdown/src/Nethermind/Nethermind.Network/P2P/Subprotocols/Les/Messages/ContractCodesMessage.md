The `ContractCodesMessage` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the P2P subprotocol Les. This class represents a message that is sent between nodes in the Ethereum network to request contract codes. 

The `ContractCodesMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is set to `LesMessageCode.ContractCodes`, which is a constant value that represents the type of message being sent. The `Protocol` property is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`, which is a constant value that represents the subprotocol being used. 

The `ContractCodesMessage` class has three public properties: `RequestId`, `BufferValue`, and `Codes`. The `RequestId` property is a long value that represents the unique identifier for the request. The `BufferValue` property is an integer value that represents the size of the buffer used to store the contract codes. The `Codes` property is an array of byte arrays that represents the contract codes being requested. 

The `ContractCodesMessage` class has two constructors. The default constructor takes no arguments and does not initialize any of the properties. The second constructor takes three arguments: `codes`, `requestId`, and `bufferValue`. These arguments are used to initialize the `Codes`, `RequestId`, and `BufferValue` properties, respectively. 

In the larger context of the Nethermind project, the `ContractCodesMessage` class is used to facilitate communication between nodes in the Ethereum network. When a node needs to request contract codes from another node, it creates an instance of the `ContractCodesMessage` class and sets the appropriate properties. This message is then sent to the other node using the P2P subprotocol Les. The receiving node can then process the message and send back the requested contract codes. 

Example usage:

```
// create an instance of ContractCodesMessage to request contract codes
byte[][] codes = new byte[][] { new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02 }, new byte[] { 0x03, 0x04 } };
long requestId = 12345;
int bufferValue = 1024;
ContractCodesMessage message = new ContractCodesMessage(codes, requestId, bufferValue);

// send the message to another node using the P2P subprotocol Les
// ...
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `ContractCodesMessage` which is a P2P message used in the Les subprotocol of the Nethermind network.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
- The `PacketType` property specifies the code for this specific message type within the Les subprotocol, while the `Protocol` property specifies the overall protocol being used (in this case, Les).

3. What is the purpose of the `Codes`, `RequestId`, and `BufferValue` properties?
- The `Codes` property is an array of byte arrays representing contract codes, while `RequestId` and `BufferValue` are used to track and manage the message request and response process within the P2P network.
