The code defines an abstract class called `HashesMessage` that is a part of the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to provide a base implementation for messages that contain a list of Keccak hashes. Keccak is a cryptographic hash function that is used in Ethereum for various purposes, such as generating addresses and verifying transactions.

The `HashesMessage` class takes in a list of Keccak hashes in its constructor and stores them in a read-only list property called `Hashes`. The constructor throws an exception if the list of hashes is null. The class also overrides the `ToString()` method to return a string representation of the class name and the number of hashes in the list.

This class is designed to be inherited by other classes that implement specific subprotocols for the Ethereum network. For example, the `GetBlockHeadersMessage` class inherits from `HashesMessage` and is used to request a list of block headers from other nodes on the network. The `BlockHeadersMessage` class also inherits from `HashesMessage` and is used to send a list of block headers to other nodes on the network.

By providing a base implementation for messages that contain Keccak hashes, the `HashesMessage` class helps to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability of the Nethermind project. It also ensures that all messages that contain Keccak hashes have a consistent interface and behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HashesMessage` class?
- The `HashesMessage` class is a base class for P2P messages that contain a list of Keccak hashes.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` class?
- The `Keccak` class is used to represent a Keccak hash, which is a cryptographic hash function used in Ethereum.

3. What is the relationship between the `HashesMessage` class and the `P2PMessage` class?
- The `HashesMessage` class is a subclass of the `P2PMessage` class, which means it inherits properties and methods from the parent class.
