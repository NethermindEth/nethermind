[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Les/Messages/GetBlockBodiesMessage.cs)

The code defines a class called `GetBlockBodiesMessage` that represents a message in the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind P2P network. The purpose of this message is to request the block bodies (i.e. the transaction data) for a set of blocks from a peer node in the network. 

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which provides some basic functionality for handling P2P messages. It has two properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. `PacketType` is an integer that identifies the type of message, and is set to the value of `LesMessageCode.GetBlockBodies`. `Protocol` is a string that identifies the subprotocol, and is set to `"Les"`. 

The class also has two public fields: `RequestId` and `EthMessage`. `RequestId` is a long integer that is used to identify the request and match it with the corresponding response. `EthMessage` is an instance of the `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` class, which represents the actual message payload. This payload contains a list of block hashes for which the block bodies are being requested. 

The class has two constructors: a default constructor that takes no arguments, and a parameterized constructor that takes an instance of `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` and a `long` integer as arguments. The parameterized constructor is used to create a new `GetBlockBodiesMessage` instance with the specified payload and request ID. 

Overall, this code is an essential part of the LES subprotocol implementation in the Nethermind P2P network. It allows nodes to request transaction data for specific blocks from their peers, which is necessary for synchronizing the blockchain data across the network. Here is an example of how this message might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
// create a new GetBlockBodiesMessage instance
var blockHashes = new List<byte[]>() { /* list of block hashes */ };
var ethMessage = new Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage(blockHashes);
var requestId = /* generate a unique request ID */;
var message = new GetBlockBodiesMessage(ethMessage, requestId);

// send the message to a peer node
var peer = /* select a peer node */;
await peer.SendAsync(message);

// wait for the response
var response = await peer.ReceiveAsync<SendBlockBodiesMessage>();
var blockBodies = response.EthMessage.BlockBodies;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetBlockBodiesMessage` class?
   - The `GetBlockBodiesMessage` class is a subprotocol message used in the Nethermind network's P2P communication to request block bodies.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
   - The `PacketType` property specifies the type of message as defined by the `LesMessageCode` enum, while the `Protocol` property specifies the P2P protocol used for the message, which in this case is `Les`.

3. What is the purpose of the `RequestId` and `EthMessage` properties?
   - The `RequestId` property is used to uniquely identify the request for block bodies, while the `EthMessage` property contains the actual request message in the form of an `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` object.
