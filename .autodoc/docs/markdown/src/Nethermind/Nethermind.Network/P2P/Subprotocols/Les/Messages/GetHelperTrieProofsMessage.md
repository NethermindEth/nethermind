This code defines a class called `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` that inherits from the `P2PMessage` class. The purpose of this class is to represent a message that can be sent over the P2P network using the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) protocol. 

The `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class has two properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is an integer that represents the type of message being sent, and is set to `LesMessageCode.GetHelperTrieProofs`. The `Protocol` property is a string that represents the protocol being used, and is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`.

In addition to these properties, the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class has two public fields: `RequestId` and `Requests`. The `RequestId` field is a long integer that represents the ID of the request being made. The `Requests` field is an array of `HelperTrieRequest` objects, which represent the requests being made for helper trie proofs.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Nethermind project's implementation of the LES protocol. It allows nodes on the P2P network to request helper trie proofs from other nodes, which can be used to verify the state of the Ethereum blockchain. Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
var message = new GetHelperTrieProofsMessage
{
    RequestId = 12345,
    Requests = new[] { new HelperTrieRequest { BlockNumber = 100000 } }
};

// Send the message over the P2P network using the LES protocol
p2pNetwork.SendMessage(message);
```

In this example, a `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` object is created with a request ID of 12345 and a single `HelperTrieRequest` object that requests helper trie proofs for block number 100000. The message is then sent over the P2P network using the LES protocol.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class?
   - The `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class is a P2P subprotocol message used to request helper trie proofs.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
   - The `PacketType` property specifies the message code for the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage`, while the `Protocol` property specifies the P2P protocol used (in this case, Les).

3. What is the `HelperTrieRequest` type and how is it used in this class?
   - The `HelperTrieRequest` type is an array of requests for helper trie proofs, which is used as a property of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class to specify the requests being made.
