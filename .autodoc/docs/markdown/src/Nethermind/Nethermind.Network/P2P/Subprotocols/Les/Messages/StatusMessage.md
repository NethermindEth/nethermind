The `StatusMessage` class is a message type used in the Nethermind project's P2P subprotocol called LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol). This message is used to exchange information about the current state of a node with other nodes in the network. 

The `StatusMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides its `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties to specify that it is a LES message. The `StatusMessage` class contains properties that represent various pieces of information about the node, such as its protocol version, network ID, total difficulty, best hash, head block number, and genesis hash. These properties are all settable, allowing a node to construct a `StatusMessage` object that accurately reflects its current state.

In addition to the required properties, the `StatusMessage` class also contains several optional properties that can be used to provide additional information about the node's capabilities and preferences. These include properties such as `AnnounceType`, `ServeHeaders`, `ServeChainSince`, `ServeRecentChain`, `ServeStateSince`, `ServeRecentState`, `TxRelay`, `BufferLimit`, `MaximumRechargeRate`, and `MaximumRequestCosts`. These properties are all nullable or have default values, indicating that they are not required to be set in a `StatusMessage`.

Overall, the `StatusMessage` class is an important part of the LES subprotocol in the Nethermind project, as it allows nodes to exchange information about their current state and capabilities. This information can be used to optimize communication between nodes and ensure that each node is operating efficiently within the network. 

Example usage:

```csharp
// Construct a new StatusMessage object
var status = new StatusMessage
{
    ProtocolVersion = 4,
    NetworkId = UInt256.One,
    TotalDifficulty = UInt256.Parse("1234567890"),
    BestHash = Keccak.Empty,
    HeadBlockNo = 12345,
    GenesisHash = Keccak.Empty,
    ServeHeaders = true,
    TxRelay = false
};

// Send the StatusMessage to another node in the network
network.Send(status);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a `StatusMessage` class for the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind network, which represents a message that can be sent between nodes to share information about the current state of the blockchain.

2. What information does a `StatusMessage` object contain?
- A `StatusMessage` object contains information such as the protocol version, network ID, total difficulty, best hash, head block number, and genesis hash of the blockchain, as well as optional fields such as whether to serve headers or transactions, and various flow control parameters.

3. What are some TODOs listed in the code comments?
- The code comments list several TODOs, including benchmarking the implementation and updating the serve times, implementing cost scaling to account for different user capabilities, implementing multiple cost lists, and potentially using a dictionary instead of an array for the maximum request costs.
