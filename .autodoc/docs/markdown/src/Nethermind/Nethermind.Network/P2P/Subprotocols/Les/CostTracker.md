The `CostTracker` class in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Les` namespace is responsible for defining the default cost table for various requests in the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES). LES is a protocol used by Ethereum clients to communicate with each other and exchange data related to the blockchain. 

The `DefaultRequestCostTable` field is a static array of `RequestCostItem` objects that define the cost of different types of requests. Each `RequestCostItem` object contains three properties: `MessageCode`, `Base`, and `Word`. `MessageCode` is an enum that represents the type of request, `Base` is the base cost of the request in gas, and `Word` is the cost per word in gas. 

The default values in `DefaultRequestCostTable` are based on the values used by the Geth client, but the comments indicate that they may be updated based on benchmarking and other factors. The comments also suggest that the implementation may be updated to include cost scaling to account for users with different capabilities and multiple cost lists to limit requests based on available resources.

Overall, the `CostTracker` class is an important component of the LES protocol implementation in the Nethermind project. It allows for the definition and management of request costs, which is crucial for ensuring efficient and fair communication between Ethereum clients. 

Example usage:
```
// Access the default request cost table
RequestCostItem[] defaultCosts = CostTracker.DefaultRequestCostTable;

// Access the cost of a specific request
RequestCostItem getHeadersCost = defaultCosts[(int)LesMessageCode.GetBlockHeaders];
int baseCost = getHeadersCost.Base;
int wordCost = getHeadersCost.Word;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CostTracker` class?
    
    The `CostTracker` class is used to define the default cost table for various requests in the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind network.

2. What are the TODOs mentioned in the code comments?
    
    The TODOs mentioned in the code comments are to benchmark the finished implementation and update the cost table based on actual server times, implement cost scaling to account for users with different capabilities, and implement multiple cost lists to limit requests based on available bandwidth, CPU time, etc.

3. What is the structure of the `DefaultRequestCostTable` array?
    
    The `DefaultRequestCostTable` array is an array of `RequestCostItem` objects, where each object represents the cost of a specific request in the LES subprotocol. The `RequestCostItem` object contains the message code, the base cost, and the cost per byte of the request.
