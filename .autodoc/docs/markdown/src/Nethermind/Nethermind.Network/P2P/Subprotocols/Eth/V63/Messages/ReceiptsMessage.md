[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V63/Messages/ReceiptsMessage.cs)

The code defines a class called `ReceiptsMessage` that represents a message in the Ethereum subprotocol of the P2P network. The purpose of this message is to transmit transaction receipts from a node to its peers. 

The `ReceiptsMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The former specifies the type of the message, which is `Eth63MessageCode.Receipts` in this case, and the latter specifies the protocol, which is `"eth"`. 

The class has a public property called `TxReceipts` that is a two-dimensional array of `TxReceipt` objects. Each `TxReceipt` object represents the receipt of a single transaction and contains information such as the amount of gas used, the status of the transaction, and the logs generated by the transaction. The `TxReceipts` array groups the receipts by block, with each element of the outer array representing a block and each element of the inner array representing a transaction within that block. 

The class has a constructor that takes a `TxReceipt[][]` parameter and assigns it to the `TxReceipts` property. If the parameter is null, an empty array is assigned instead. 

The class also defines a static property called `Empty` that returns a singleton instance of the `ReceiptsMessage` class with a null `TxReceipts` property. This is useful when a node wants to send a receipts message with no receipts, as it avoids the overhead of creating a new instance every time. 

Finally, the class overrides the `ToString()` method to return a string representation of the message that includes the number of receipts in the `TxReceipts` array. 

Overall, the `ReceiptsMessage` class is an important part of the Ethereum subprotocol of the P2P network, as it allows nodes to share transaction receipts with each other. It is used in conjunction with other message types to synchronize the state of the blockchain across the network. 

Example usage:

```
// create a receipts message with two blocks and three transactions each
var receipts = new TxReceipt[2][];
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
{
    receipts[i] = new TxReceipt[3];
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
    {
        receipts[i][j] = new TxReceipt();
    }
}
var message = new ReceiptsMessage(receipts);

// send the message to a peer
peer.SendMessage(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `ReceiptsMessage` which represents a P2P message for transmitting transaction receipts in the Ethereum network.

2. What is the significance of the `TxReceipts` property?
- The `TxReceipts` property is a two-dimensional array of `TxReceipt` objects, where each element represents the receipts for a block of transactions.

3. What is the purpose of the `Empty` property?
- The `Empty` property is a static instance of the `ReceiptsMessage` class that represents an empty message with no transaction receipts. It is used to avoid creating unnecessary objects when an empty message is needed.
