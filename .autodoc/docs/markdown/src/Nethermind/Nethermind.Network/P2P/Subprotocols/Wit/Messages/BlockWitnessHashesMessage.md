[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Wit/Messages/BlockWitnessHashesMessage.cs)

The code above defines a class called `BlockWitnessHashesMessage` that represents a message in the Nethermind P2P subprotocol called `wit`. This message contains an array of `Keccak` hashes and a `RequestId`. 

The `BlockWitnessHashesMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all P2P messages in the Nethermind project. The `PacketType` property is overridden to return a specific code for this message type (`WitMessageCode.BlockWitnessHashes`). The `Protocol` property is also overridden to return the string `"wit"`, indicating that this message belongs to the `wit` subprotocol.

The `RequestId` property is a `long` value that uniquely identifies the request associated with this message. The `Hashes` property is an array of `Keccak` hashes, which are used in Ethereum to represent the root of a Merkle tree. 

This message is used to request the witness hashes for a block from a peer in the network. The witness hashes are used in the Ethereum protocol to represent the transaction data in a more efficient way. By requesting these hashes from a peer, a node can reconstruct the full block data without having to download all the transaction data. 

Here is an example of how this message might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```csharp
// create a new message to request witness hashes for block 12345
var message = new BlockWitnessHashesMessage(12345, new Keccak[] { });

// send the message to a peer in the network
var peer = GetRandomPeer();
peer.Send(message);

// wait for the peer to respond with the requested witness hashes
var response = peer.Receive();
if (response is BlockWitnessHashesMessage blockWitnesses)
{
    // process the witness hashes
    ProcessWitnessHashes(blockWitnesses.Hashes);
}
```

In this example, a new `BlockWitnessHashesMessage` is created with a `RequestId` of 12345 and an empty array of `Keccak` hashes. The message is then sent to a random peer in the network using the `Send` method. The code then waits for a response from the peer using the `Receive` method. If the response is a `BlockWitnessHashesMessage`, the witness hashes are extracted from the message and processed using the `ProcessWitnessHashes` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockWitnessHashesMessage` class?
- The `BlockWitnessHashesMessage` class is a P2P message subprotocol used for sending block witness hashes.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
- The `PacketType` property specifies the type of P2P message, while the `Protocol` property specifies the subprotocol used for the message.

3. What is the `Keccak` class used for in this code?
- The `Keccak` class is used for representing a Keccak hash, which is a type of cryptographic hash function. It is used to store the block witness hashes in the `Hashes` property.
