[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V65/IPooledTxsRequestor.cs)

This code defines an interface called `IPooledTxsRequestor` that is part of the Nethermind project. The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to request transactions from a pool of unconfirmed transactions. 

The `IPooledTxsRequestor` interface has two methods: `RequestTransactions` and `RequestTransactionsEth66`. Both methods take a list of `Keccak` hashes as input and a delegate function that sends a message to request the transactions. The difference between the two methods is that `RequestTransactions` sends a message of type `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` while `RequestTransactionsEth66` sends a message of type `V66.Messages.GetPooledTransactionsMessage`. 

The `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` and `V66.Messages.GetPooledTransactionsMessage` messages are part of the Ethereum subprotocol and are used to request unconfirmed transactions from other nodes in the network. These messages contain a list of transaction hashes that the requesting node wants to retrieve from the pool. 

The `IPooledTxsRequestor` interface is likely used by other classes or modules in the Nethermind project that need to retrieve unconfirmed transactions from the network. For example, a module that validates transactions may use this interface to retrieve unconfirmed transactions from the network and check their validity. 

Overall, this code provides a way to request unconfirmed transactions from the network and is an important part of the Nethermind project's functionality.
