[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Les/Messages/GetReceiptsMessage.cs)

The code above defines a class called `GetReceiptsMessage` that is part of the Nethermind project. This class is used to represent a message that requests receipts for a given block from other nodes in the Ethereum network. 

The `GetReceiptsMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all messages used in the peer-to-peer (P2P) communication protocol of the Ethereum network. This means that the `GetReceiptsMessage` class has access to all the properties and methods defined in the `P2PMessage` class.

The `GetReceiptsMessage` class has two properties: `RequestId` and `EthMessage`. The `RequestId` property is a long integer that represents the unique identifier of the request. The `EthMessage` property is an instance of the `Eth.V63.Messages.GetReceiptsMessage` class, which is used to represent the actual message that is sent over the network.

The `GetReceiptsMessage` class has two constructors. The first constructor is empty and does not take any arguments. The second constructor takes two arguments: an instance of the `Eth.V63.Messages.GetReceiptsMessage` class and a long integer representing the request ID. This constructor is used to create a new instance of the `GetReceiptsMessage` class with the specified `EthMessage` and `RequestId` properties.

Overall, the `GetReceiptsMessage` class is an important part of the P2P communication protocol in the Ethereum network. It allows nodes to request receipts for a given block from other nodes in the network, which is necessary for verifying the validity of transactions and blocks. This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate P2P communication between nodes in the Ethereum network. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new instance of the GetReceiptsMessage class
var message = new GetReceiptsMessage(new Eth.V63.Messages.GetReceiptsMessage(), 12345);

// send the message over the network
network.Send(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `GetReceiptsMessage` which is a P2P message used in the Les subprotocol of the Nethermind network.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
- The `PacketType` property specifies the code for this specific message type within the Les subprotocol, while the `Protocol` property specifies the overall protocol being used (in this case, Les).

3. What is the purpose of the `GetReceiptsMessage` constructor with parameters?
- This constructor is used to initialize the `EthMessage` and `RequestId` properties of a new `GetReceiptsMessage` instance with specific values passed in as arguments.
