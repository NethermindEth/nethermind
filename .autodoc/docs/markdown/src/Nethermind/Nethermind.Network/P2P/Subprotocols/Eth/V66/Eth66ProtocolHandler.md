The `Eth66ProtocolHandler` class is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P network protocol. It extends the `Eth65ProtocolHandler` class and implements the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 2481. This EIP defines a new version of the Ethereum subprotocol, which is used to communicate between Ethereum nodes. The `Eth66ProtocolHandler` class is responsible for handling messages related to this new subprotocol version.

The class contains several message dictionaries that map incoming messages to their corresponding responses. For example, the `_headersRequests66` dictionary maps `GetBlockHeadersMessage` objects to `V62.Messages.GetBlockHeadersMessage` objects, which are then used to retrieve block headers from the Ethereum blockchain. Similarly, the `_bodiesRequests66` dictionary maps `GetBlockBodiesMessage` objects to `V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` objects, which are used to retrieve block bodies.

The class also contains methods for handling incoming messages, such as `Handle(GetBlockHeadersMessage getBlockHeaders)` and `Handle(GetBlockBodiesMessage getBlockBodies)`. These methods use the message dictionaries to retrieve the appropriate response and send it back to the requesting node.

The `Eth66ProtocolHandler` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to implement the Ethereum P2P network protocol. It is responsible for handling messages related to the new subprotocol version defined in EIP 2481. This allows Nethermind nodes to communicate with other Ethereum nodes that support this new subprotocol version.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the Eth66ProtocolHandler class, which is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P network.

2. What other classes does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several other classes from the Nethermind project, including ISession, IMessageSerializationService, INodeStatsManager, ISyncServer, ITxPool, IPooledTxsRequestor, IGossipPolicy, ForkInfo, and ILogManager.

3. What is the difference between Eth65ProtocolHandler and Eth66ProtocolHandler?
- Eth66ProtocolHandler is a subclass of Eth65ProtocolHandler and provides additional functionality for handling certain types of messages in the Ethereum P2P network, such as GetNodeDataMessage and GetReceiptsMessage.
