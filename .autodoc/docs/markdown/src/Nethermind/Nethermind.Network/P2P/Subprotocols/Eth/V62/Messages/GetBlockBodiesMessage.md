[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V62/Messages/GetBlockBodiesMessage.cs)

The code defines a class called `GetBlockBodiesMessage` that represents a message in the Ethereum v62 subprotocol of the P2P network. The purpose of this message is to request the bodies of one or more blocks from a peer node in the network. The bodies of a block include the transactions and the uncles of the block.

The class has two constructors that take a list of `Keccak` hashes of the blocks whose bodies are being requested. The `Keccak` class is defined in the `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespace and represents a 256-bit hash value used in Ethereum. The first constructor takes an `IReadOnlyList<Keccak>` parameter, while the second constructor takes a variable number of `Keccak` parameters and converts them to a read-only list.

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all messages in the P2P network. It overrides three properties of the base class: `PacketType`, `Protocol`, and `ToString`. The `PacketType` property is set to the value of the `Eth62MessageCode.GetBlockBodies` constant, which is an integer code that identifies this message type. The `Protocol` property is set to the string "eth", which indicates that this message belongs to the Ethereum subprotocol. The `ToString` method returns a string representation of the message that includes the name of the class and the number of block hashes in the message.

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to implement the Ethereum P2P network protocol. When a node wants to request the bodies of one or more blocks from a peer node, it creates an instance of this class with the appropriate block hashes and sends it to the peer using the P2P network. The peer node can then respond with a `BlockBodiesMessage` that contains the requested block bodies.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `GetBlockBodiesMessage` which is a P2P message used in the Ethereum subprotocol to request block bodies by their hashes.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` type?
   - The `Keccak` type is used to represent the hash of a block in Ethereum. It is a specific implementation of the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function.

3. What is the difference between the two constructors for `GetBlockBodiesMessage`?
   - The first constructor takes an `IReadOnlyList<Keccak>` parameter, while the second constructor takes a variable number of `Keccak` parameters and converts them to an `IReadOnlyList<Keccak>`. The second constructor is provided for convenience.
