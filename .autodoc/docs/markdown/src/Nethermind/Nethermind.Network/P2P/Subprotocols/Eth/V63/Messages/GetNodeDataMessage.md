[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V63/Messages/GetNodeDataMessage.cs)

The code above is a C# class file that defines a message type for the Ethereum (ETH) subprotocol version 63 (V63) used in the Nethermind project. Specifically, it defines the `GetNodeDataMessage` class that inherits from the `HashesMessage` class and implements the `IP2PMessage` interface. 

The `GetNodeDataMessage` class represents a message that requests a list of node data from other nodes in the Ethereum network. The `HashesMessage` class it inherits from is a base class for messages that contain a list of hashes, which in this case are `Keccak` hashes. The `IReadOnlyList<Keccak> keys` parameter in the constructor of `GetNodeDataMessage` is used to pass in the list of hashes to request from other nodes. 

The `PacketType` property of `GetNodeDataMessage` is set to `Eth63MessageCode.GetNodeData`, which is a constant value representing the message code for this message type in the ETH V63 subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `"eth"`, indicating that this message belongs to the ETH subprotocol. 

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project as part of the P2P networking layer that facilitates communication between nodes in the Ethereum network. When a node receives a `GetNodeDataMessage`, it should respond with a `NodeDataMessage` containing the requested node data. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Nethermind project:

```csharp
// create a list of Keccak hashes to request from other nodes
List<Keccak> keys = new List<Keccak>();
keys.Add(new Keccak("0x123456789abcdef"));
keys.Add(new Keccak("0x987654321fedcba"));

// create a GetNodeDataMessage with the list of hashes
GetNodeDataMessage message = new GetNodeDataMessage(keys);

// send the message to other nodes in the Ethereum network
network.Send(message);
```

Overall, this code defines a message type that is used to request node data from other nodes in the Ethereum network as part of the P2P networking layer in the Nethermind project.
