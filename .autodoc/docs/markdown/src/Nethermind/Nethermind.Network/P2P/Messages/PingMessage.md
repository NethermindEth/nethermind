The `PingMessage` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is located in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Messages` namespace. This class represents a P2P message that is used to ping a peer in the network. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of sending a ping message to a peer in the network. The `PingMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all P2P messages in the Nethermind project. This means that the `PingMessage` class has access to all the properties and methods of the `P2PMessage` class.

The `PingMessage` class has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. Instead, the class provides a public static `Instance` property that returns a singleton instance of the `PingMessage` class. This ensures that there is only one instance of the `PingMessage` class in the entire application.

The `PingMessage` class overrides two properties of the `P2PMessage` class: `Protocol` and `PacketType`. The `Protocol` property returns the string "p2p", which indicates that this message is a P2P message. The `PacketType` property returns the integer value of the `P2PMessageCode.Ping` constant, which indicates that this message is a ping message.

The `PingMessage` class also overrides the `ToString()` method, which returns the string "Ping". This method is used to convert the `PingMessage` object to a string representation.

Overall, the `PingMessage` class provides a standardized way of sending a ping message to a peer in the network. This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to ensure that all ping messages are sent in a consistent manner. 

Example usage:

```
PingMessage pingMessage = PingMessage.Instance;
string protocol = pingMessage.Protocol; // returns "p2p"
int packetType = pingMessage.PacketType; // returns the integer value of the P2PMessageCode.Ping constant
string messageString = pingMessage.ToString(); // returns "Ping"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PingMessage` class?
   - The `PingMessage` class is a subclass of `P2PMessage` and represents a message used in the Nethermind network's peer-to-peer communication protocol to initiate a ping-pong handshake between nodes.

2. Why is the `Instance` field declared as `static` and `readonly`?
   - The `Instance` field is declared as `static` and `readonly` to ensure that only one instance of the `PingMessage` class is created and shared across all instances of the `P2PMessage` class, which helps to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

3. What is the significance of the `Protocol` and `PacketType` properties?
   - The `Protocol` property returns the name of the protocol used for the message, which is "p2p" in this case. The `PacketType` property returns the unique code assigned to the `PingMessage` class, which is `P2PMessageCode.Ping`. These properties are used to identify and handle different types of messages in the Nethermind network's peer-to-peer communication protocol.
