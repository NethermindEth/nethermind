The code above defines a class called `DisconnectMessage` that inherits from the `P2PMessage` class. This class is used to represent a message that is sent over the peer-to-peer (P2P) network to disconnect from a peer. 

The `DisconnectMessage` class has two constructors that take either a `DisconnectReason` enum or an integer as a parameter. The `DisconnectReason` enum is defined in the `Nethermind.Stats.Model` namespace and contains a list of reasons for disconnecting from a peer, such as `BadProtocol`, `TooManyPeers`, and `InvalidIdentity`. The integer parameter can be used to specify a custom reason for disconnection.

The `DisconnectMessage` class also has a `Reason` property that returns the reason for disconnection as an integer. This property is read-only and is set by the constructor.

The `DisconnectMessage` class overrides two properties from the `P2PMessage` class: `Protocol` and `PacketType`. The `Protocol` property returns the string `"p2p"`, indicating that this message is part of the P2P protocol. The `PacketType` property returns the integer value `P2PMessageCode.Disconnect`, which is a constant defined in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Messages` namespace.

Finally, the `DisconnectMessage` class overrides the `ToString()` method to return a string representation of the message in the format `"Disconnect(reason)"`, where `reason` is the integer value of the `Reason` property.

Overall, the `DisconnectMessage` class is a simple implementation of a message that can be sent over the P2P network to disconnect from a peer. It provides a way to specify a reason for disconnection and includes a string representation of the message for debugging purposes. This class is likely used in conjunction with other P2P message classes to facilitate communication between nodes in the Nethermind project. 

Example usage:

```
var disconnectMessage = new DisconnectMessage(DisconnectReason.BadProtocol);
int reason = disconnectMessage.Reason; // returns 1
string messageString = disconnectMessage.ToString(); // returns "Disconnect(1)"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectMessage` class?
   - The `DisconnectMessage` class is a subclass of `P2PMessage` and represents a message used to disconnect from a peer in the P2P network.

2. What is the significance of the `DisconnectReason` parameter in the constructor?
   - The `DisconnectReason` parameter is used to set the `Reason` property of the `DisconnectMessage` object, which indicates the reason for the disconnection.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `ToString()` method for a `DisconnectMessage` object?
   - The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the `DisconnectMessage` object in the format "Disconnect(reason)", where "reason" is the value of the `Reason` property.
