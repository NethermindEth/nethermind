The code above defines a class called `DisconnectEventArgs` that is used to represent the event arguments for a disconnection event in the Nethermind project's P2P network module. The class inherits from the `System.EventArgs` class, which is a base class for event argument classes in C#.

The `DisconnectEventArgs` class has three properties: `DisconnectReason`, `DisconnectType`, and `Details`. `DisconnectReason` is of type `DisconnectReason`, which is an enum that represents the reason for the disconnection. `DisconnectType` is of type `DisconnectType`, which is another enum that represents the type of disconnection. Finally, `Details` is of type `string` and represents any additional details about the disconnection.

The constructor for the `DisconnectEventArgs` class takes in three parameters: `disconnectReason`, `disconnectType`, and `details`. These parameters are used to initialize the corresponding properties of the class.

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about disconnection events that occur in the P2P network module. For example, when a node disconnects from the network, an event may be raised with an instance of the `DisconnectEventArgs` class as the event arguments. This allows other parts of the project to handle the disconnection event appropriately based on the reason and type of disconnection, as well as any additional details that may be relevant.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
public void OnDisconnect(object sender, DisconnectEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.DisconnectType == DisconnectType.Unresponsive)
    {
        // Handle unresponsive node disconnection
    }
    else if (e.DisconnectReason == DisconnectReason.Ban)
    {
        // Handle banned node disconnection
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle other types of disconnection
    }
}
```

In this example, the `OnDisconnect` method is an event handler that is called when a node disconnects from the network. The method checks the `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason` properties of the `DisconnectEventArgs` instance to determine how to handle the disconnection.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectEventArgs` class?
   - The `DisconnectEventArgs` class is used to define event arguments for a disconnection event in the P2P network, including the reason for disconnection, the type of disconnection, and any additional details.

2. What is the `DisconnectReason` enum used for?
   - The `DisconnectReason` enum is used to define the reason for a disconnection event in the P2P network, such as a timeout or a protocol error.

3. What is the `DisconnectType` enum used for?
   - The `DisconnectType` enum is used to define the type of disconnection event in the P2P network, such as a voluntary or involuntary disconnection.
