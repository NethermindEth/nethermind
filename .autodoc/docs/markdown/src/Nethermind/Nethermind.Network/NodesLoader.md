The `NodesLoader` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for loading and managing the list of nodes that the client will connect to. It implements the `INodeSource` interface, which defines the methods for loading and managing nodes.

The `NodesLoader` class has a constructor that takes in several dependencies, including the `INetworkConfig` object, `INodeStatsManager` object, `INetworkStorage` object, `IRlpxHost` object, and `ILogManager` object. These dependencies are used to load and manage the list of nodes.

The `LoadInitialList` method is responsible for loading the initial list of nodes. It first loads the peers from the database by calling the `LoadPeersFromDb` method. It then loads the boot nodes and static nodes from the configuration file by calling the `LoadConfigPeers` method. Finally, it filters out the local node and any non-static nodes if the `OnlyStaticPeers` configuration option is set to true.

The `LoadPeersFromDb` method loads the persisted nodes from the database if the `IsPeersPersistenceOn` configuration option is set to true. It then creates a new `Node` object for each persisted node and adds it to the list of peers.

The `LoadConfigPeers` method loads the nodes from the configuration file. It first checks if the configuration string is null or empty. If it is not, it calls the `NetworkNode.ParseNodes` method to parse the configuration string into a list of `NetworkNode` objects. It then creates a new `Node` object for each `NetworkNode` object and adds it to the list of peers.

The `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events are not implemented in this class and are just empty implementations of the `INodeSource` interface.

Overall, the `NodesLoader` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it is responsible for loading and managing the list of nodes that the client will connect to. It uses the configuration file and the database to load the initial list of nodes and filters out any non-static nodes if the `OnlyStaticPeers` configuration option is set to true.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodesLoader` class?
- The `NodesLoader` class is an implementation of the `INodeSource` interface and is responsible for loading and managing a list of network nodes.

2. What are the sources of nodes that the `LoadInitialList` method loads?
- The `LoadInitialList` method loads nodes from a database (if enabled), as well as from bootnodes and static peers specified in the network configuration.

3. What is the purpose of the `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events?
- The `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events are not implemented and do not have any functionality in this class. It is possible that they are intended to be used by other classes that interact with `NodesLoader` to be notified when nodes are added or removed from the list.
