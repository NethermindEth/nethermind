The `CompositeNodeSource` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to combine multiple `INodeSource` instances into a single source of nodes. This class implements the `INodeSource` interface and provides an implementation for the `LoadInitialList()` method, which returns a list of all the nodes from all the sources combined. 

The `CompositeNodeSource` constructor takes in an array of `INodeSource` instances and subscribes to the `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events of each source. When a node is added or removed from any of the sources, the corresponding event is raised and the `CompositeNodeSource` instance raises its own `NodeAdded` or `NodeRemoved` event, respectively. 

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a unified source of nodes for various components such as the peer discovery mechanism or the node selection algorithm. For example, the `CompositeNodeSource` instance can be passed to the `PeerManager` class, which manages the connections to other nodes in the network. The `PeerManager` can then use the `LoadInitialList()` method to get a list of all the available nodes and connect to them. 

Here is an example of how the `CompositeNodeSource` class can be used:

```csharp
var nodeSource1 = new SomeNodeSource();
var nodeSource2 = new AnotherNodeSource();
var compositeNodeSource = new CompositeNodeSource(nodeSource1, nodeSource2);

var peerManager = new PeerManager(compositeNodeSource);
var nodes = compositeNodeSource.LoadInitialList();

foreach (var node in nodes)
{
    peerManager.Connect(node);
}
```

In this example, two `INodeSource` instances are created and passed to the `CompositeNodeSource` constructor. The resulting `CompositeNodeSource` instance is then passed to the `PeerManager` constructor, which manages the connections to the nodes. Finally, the `LoadInitialList()` method is called to get a list of all the available nodes, which are then connected to using the `Connect()` method of the `PeerManager`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeNodeSource` class?
- The `CompositeNodeSource` class is an implementation of the `INodeSource` interface and provides a way to combine multiple `INodeSource` instances into a single source of nodes.

2. What does the `LoadInitialList` method do?
- The `LoadInitialList` method returns a list of all nodes from all the `INodeSource` instances that were passed to the constructor of the `CompositeNodeSource` class.

3. What events does the `CompositeNodeSource` class handle?
- The `CompositeNodeSource` class handles the `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events, which are raised by the `INodeSource` instances that were passed to its constructor.
