The `StaticNodesManager` class is responsible for managing a list of static nodes that can be used to connect to the Ethereum network. Static nodes are nodes that are pre-defined and do not change frequently, unlike dynamic nodes that are discovered at runtime. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to manage the list of static nodes, which can be used by other parts of the Nethermind project to connect to the network.

The class uses a `ConcurrentDictionary` to store the list of nodes, where the key is the `PublicKey` of the node and the value is a `NetworkNode` object that contains information about the node, such as its `enode` URL and IP address. The `Nodes` property returns an `IEnumerable` of `NetworkNode` objects that represent the list of nodes.

The `InitAsync` method is responsible for initializing the list of nodes by reading them from a file. The file path is passed to the constructor of the class, and the `GetApplicationResourcePath` method is used to get the full path of the file. If the file does not exist, the method returns without doing anything. If the file exists, it is read and parsed to get the list of nodes. The method uses the `GetNodes` method to parse the file, which can handle both JSON and plain text formats. The parsed nodes are then added to the dictionary using the `TryAdd` method.

The `AddAsync` and `RemoveAsync` methods are used to add and remove nodes from the list. The `enode` URL of the node is passed as a parameter, and a new `NetworkNode` object is created from it. The `TryAdd` and `TryRemove` methods are used to add and remove the node from the dictionary. If the operation is successful, a `NodeAdded` or `NodeRemoved` event is raised, and the list of nodes is saved to the file using the `SaveFileAsync` method.

The `IsStatic` method is used to check if a given `enode` URL is in the list of static nodes. It creates a new `NetworkNode` object from the URL and checks if it exists in the dictionary.

The `LoadInitialList` method is used to get the list of nodes as a list of `Node` objects, which contain additional information such as the `NodeId` and `Host` of the node. This method is used by other parts of the Nethermind project to get the list of nodes.

Overall, the `StaticNodesManager` class provides a way to manage a list of static nodes that can be used to connect to the Ethereum network. It can be used by other parts of the Nethermind project to get the list of nodes, add or remove nodes from the list, and check if a given node is in the list.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StaticNodesManager` class?
- The `StaticNodesManager` class is responsible for managing a collection of static nodes, which are nodes that are manually added to the network configuration and do not change frequently.

2. What is the significance of the `PublicKey` and `NetworkNode` classes?
- The `PublicKey` class represents a public key used for cryptographic operations, while the `NetworkNode` class represents a node on the network, including its host and port information.

3. What is the purpose of the `InitAsync` method?
- The `InitAsync` method initializes the `StaticNodesManager` by reading a file containing a list of static nodes, parsing the nodes, and adding them to the collection of nodes managed by the class.
