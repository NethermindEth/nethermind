The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for removing the snap capability after the SnapSync process is finished. This class is part of the Nethermind project and is located in the Network namespace. The purpose of this class is to add the Snap capability to the protocols manager and remove it after the SnapSync process is finished.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has three private fields: `_protocolsManager`, `_syncModeSelector`, and `_logger`. The `_protocolsManager` field is an instance of the `IProtocolsManager` interface, which is responsible for managing the protocols used by the P2P network. The `_syncModeSelector` field is an instance of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface, which is responsible for selecting the synchronization mode used by the node. The `_logger` field is an instance of the `ILogger` interface, which is responsible for logging messages.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `protocolsManager`, `syncModeSelector`, and `logManager`. These parameters are used to initialize the private fields of the class. If any of these parameters are null, an `ArgumentNullException` is thrown.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a public method called `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced()`. This method adds the Snap capability to the protocols manager and registers an event handler for the `Changed` event of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface. If the logger is in debug mode, a debug message is logged.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a private method called `OnSyncModeChanged()`. This method is called when the synchronization mode changes. If the current synchronization mode is `SyncMode.Full`, the Snap capability is removed from the protocols manager, and the event handler for the `Changed` event is unregistered. If the logger is in info mode, an info message is logged.

In summary, the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for managing the Snap capability during the SnapSync process. It adds the Snap capability to the protocols manager and removes it after the SnapSync process is finished. This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to manage the protocols used by the P2P network. An example of how this class may be used is shown below:

```
var protocolsManager = new ProtocolsManager();
var syncModeSelector = new SyncModeSelector();
var logManager = new LogManager();

var snapCapabilitySwitcher = new SnapCapabilitySwitcher(protocolsManager, syncModeSelector, logManager);
snapCapabilitySwitcher.EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class?
- The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for removing snap capability after SnapSync finish until the missing functionality is implemented.

2. What are the dependencies of the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class?
- The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class depends on `IProtocolsManager`, `ISyncModeSelector`, and `ILogManager`.

3. What does the `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced` method do?
- The `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced` method adds Snap capability if SnapSync is not finished and removes it after finished.
