The `IPResolver` class is responsible for resolving the local and external IP addresses of a node in the Nethermind network. It implements the `IIPResolver` interface and has two public properties: `LocalIp` and `ExternalIp`, which store the resolved IP addresses.

The `IPResolver` class has two private methods: `InitializeExternalIp()` and `InitializeLocalIp()`. Both methods return a `Task<IPAddress>` and use a set of `IIPSource` objects to resolve the IP address. The `IIPSource` interface defines a single method `TryGetIP()` that returns a tuple of a boolean and an `IPAddress`. The boolean indicates whether the IP address was successfully resolved, and the `IPAddress` is the resolved IP address.

The `InitializeExternalIp()` method uses a set of `IIPSource` objects to resolve the external IP address. The `GetIPSources()` method returns an `IEnumerable<IIPSource>` that contains the following `IIPSource` objects:

- `EnvironmentVariableIPSource`: This source reads the `EXTERNAL_IP` environment variable to get the external IP address.
- `NetworkConfigExternalIPSource`: This source reads the `externalip` configuration value from the network configuration file to get the external IP address.
- `WebIPSource`: This source sends an HTTP request to a set of URLs to get the external IP address.

The `InitializeLocalIp()` method uses a set of `IIPSource` objects to resolve the local IP address. The `GetIPSources()` method returns an `IEnumerable<IIPSource>` that contains the following `IIPSource` objects:

- `NetworkConfigLocalIPSource`: This source reads the `bind.ip` configuration value from the network configuration file to get the local IP address.
- `SocketIPSource`: This source creates a socket connection to a remote server and gets the local IP address of the socket.

The `Initialize()` method initializes the `LocalIp` and `ExternalIp` properties by calling the `InitializeLocalIp()` and `InitializeExternalIp()` methods, respectively. If an exception occurs while resolving the IP address, the `LocalIp` or `ExternalIp` property is set to `IPAddress.Loopback`.

Overall, the `IPResolver` class is an important component of the Nethermind network that enables nodes to resolve their IP addresses. The resolved IP addresses are used by other components of the network to establish connections with other nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IPResolver` class?
    
    The `IPResolver` class is responsible for resolving the local and external IP addresses of a node.

2. What are the sources used to obtain the external IP address?
    
    The sources used to obtain the external IP address include environment variables, network configuration, and several web-based sources such as `ipv4.icanhazip.com` and `api.ipify.org`.

3. What happens if an exception is thrown while obtaining the local or external IP address?
    
    If an exception is thrown while obtaining the local or external IP address, the `LocalIp` or `ExternalIp` property is set to `IPAddress.Loopback` or `IPAddress.None`, respectively. Additionally, an error message is logged if the logger is set to error level.
