The `SessionMonitor` class is responsible for monitoring and managing P2P sessions in the Nethermind network. It implements the `ISessionMonitor` interface and provides methods to start and stop the session monitor. 

When a new session is added, the `AddSession` method is called, which adds the session to a concurrent dictionary of sessions. If the session is not in the process of disconnecting, it is added to the dictionary. When a session is disconnected, it is removed from the dictionary.

The `Start` method starts a timer that sends ping messages to all the sessions in the dictionary at regular intervals. The `Stop` method stops the timer.

The `SendPingMessages` method sends ping messages to all the sessions in the dictionary that have not received a ping message in the last ping interval. It uses the `SendPingMessage` method to send the ping message to each session. If a session does not respond to the ping message, it is considered unresponsive. The method logs the number of successful and failed ping messages.

The `SendPingMessage` method sends a ping message to a session and waits for a pong message. If a pong message is not received, the session is considered unresponsive. The method logs the time of the ping message and the last pong message received from the session.

The `SessionMonitor` class is used by other classes in the Nethermind network to manage P2P sessions. For example, the `P2PProtocol` class uses the `SessionMonitor` class to manage P2P sessions. 

```csharp
ISessionMonitor sessionMonitor = new SessionMonitor(networkConfig, logManager);
sessionMonitor.Start();
```

The above code creates a new instance of the `SessionMonitor` class and starts the session monitor.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SessionMonitor` class?
- The `SessionMonitor` class is responsible for monitoring and managing P2P sessions in the Nethermind network.

2. What is the significance of the `SendPingMessages` method?
- The `SendPingMessages` method sends ping messages to all initialized P2P sessions that have not received a ping within the specified interval. It then waits for responses and logs any failures.

3. What is the role of the `_pingTasks` list?
- The `_pingTasks` list stores the `Task<bool>` objects returned by the `SendPingMessage` method for each P2P session that is sent a ping message. It is used to wait for all tasks to complete before logging the results.
