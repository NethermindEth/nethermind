The `NetworkConfig` class is a configuration class that defines various properties related to network connectivity and communication for the Nethermind project. This class implements the `INetworkConfig` interface, which defines a set of properties that can be used to configure the network settings for the Nethermind client.

The `NetworkConfig` class has several properties that can be used to configure the network settings. These properties include `ExternalIp`, `LocalIp`, `StaticPeers`, and `DiscoveryDns`, which are used to specify the IP addresses and DNS servers for the network. The `OnlyStaticPeers` property is a boolean value that indicates whether the client should only connect to static peers. The `IsPeersPersistenceOn` property is another boolean value that indicates whether the client should persist peer information.

The `ActivePeersMaxCount` property is deprecated and has been replaced by the `MaxActivePeers` property, which specifies the maximum number of active peers that the client can connect to. The `PriorityPeersMaxCount` property specifies the maximum number of priority peers that the client can connect to. The `PeersPersistenceInterval` property specifies the interval at which the client should persist peer information. The `PeersUpdateInterval` property specifies the interval at which the client should update peer information.

The `P2PPingInterval` property specifies the interval at which the client should ping peers to check their availability. The `MaxPersistedPeerCount` property specifies the maximum number of persisted peers that the client can store. The `PersistedPeerCountCleanupThreshold` property specifies the threshold at which the client should clean up persisted peer information. The `MaxCandidatePeerCount` property specifies the maximum number of candidate peers that the client can store. The `CandidatePeerCountCleanupThreshold` property specifies the threshold at which the client should clean up candidate peer information.

The `DiagTracerEnabled` property is a boolean value that indicates whether diagnostic tracing is enabled. The `NettyArenaOrder` property specifies the order in which Netty arenas should be created. The `MaxNettyArenaCount` property specifies the maximum number of Netty arenas that can be created. The `Bootnodes` property specifies the boot nodes for the network. The `EnableUPnP` property is a boolean value that indicates whether UPnP is enabled. The `DiscoveryPort` property specifies the port for discovery. The `P2PPort` property specifies the port for P2P communication. The `SimulateSendLatencyMs` property specifies the simulated latency for sending messages.

Overall, the `NetworkConfig` class provides a way to configure various network settings for the Nethermind client. These settings can be used to customize the behavior of the client and optimize its performance. For example, the `MaxActivePeers` property can be increased to allow the client to connect to more peers, which can improve the speed and reliability of the network. Similarly, the `PeersPersistenceInterval` property can be decreased to ensure that peer information is persisted more frequently, which can help prevent data loss in the event of a crash or other failure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `NetworkConfig` that implements the `INetworkConfig` interface.

2. What properties are included in the `NetworkConfig` class?
- The `NetworkConfig` class includes properties such as `ExternalIp`, `LocalIp`, `StaticPeers`, `DiscoveryDns`, `OnlyStaticPeers`, `IsPeersPersistenceOn`, `MaxActivePeers`, `PriorityPeersMaxCount`, `PeersPersistenceInterval`, `PeersUpdateInterval`, `P2PPingInterval`, `MaxPersistedPeerCount`, `PersistedPeerCountCleanupThreshold`, `MaxCandidatePeerCount`, `CandidatePeerCountCleanupThreshold`, `DiagTracerEnabled`, `NettyArenaOrder`, `MaxNettyArenaCount`, `Bootnodes`, `EnableUPnP`, `DiscoveryPort`, `P2PPort`, and `SimulateSendLatencyMs`.

3. What is the purpose of the `[Obsolete]` attribute on the `ActivePeersMaxCount` property?
- The `[Obsolete]` attribute indicates that the `ActivePeersMaxCount` property is no longer recommended to be used and has been replaced by the `MaxActivePeers` property.
