The `FrameHeaderReader` class is responsible for reading the header of a RLPx frame. RLPx is a protocol used for encrypted and authenticated communication between Ethereum nodes. The header of a RLPx frame contains information about the size of the frame, whether it is part of a larger message, and if so, what the total size of the message is.

The `ReadFrameHeader` method takes an `IByteBuffer` as input, which is a buffer containing the bytes of the frame header. The method reads the first three bytes of the header to determine the size of the frame. The size is encoded as a 24-bit integer, with the most significant byte first. The method then reads the remaining 13 bytes of the header, which contain additional information about the frame.

The `headerBodyItems` variable is a `ValueDecoderContext` object that is used to decode the RLP-encoded data in the header. The first item in the header is an adaptive ID, which is not needed and is therefore decoded and discarded. The second item is an optional context ID, which is used to identify a sequence of frames that belong to the same message. The third item is an optional total packet size, which is the size of the entire message. If the total packet size is not present, the size of the frame is used as the total packet size.

The `FrameInfo` struct is used to store the information read from the header. It contains four properties: `IsChunked`, `IsFirst`, `Size`, and `TotalPacketSize`. The `IsChunked` property is `true` if the frame is part of a larger message, and `false` otherwise. The `IsFirst` property is `true` if the frame is the first frame of a message, and `false` otherwise. The `Size` property is the size of the frame, and the `TotalPacketSize` property is the total size of the message. The `Padding` property is the number of padding bytes that must be added to the frame to make it a multiple of 16 bytes. The `PayloadSize` property is the size of the frame plus the padding.

Overall, the `FrameHeaderReader` class is an important component of the RLPx protocol implementation in the Nethermind project. It provides a way to read the header of a RLPx frame and extract important information about the frame and the message it belongs to. This information is used by other components of the protocol to handle incoming frames and assemble complete messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a `FrameHeaderReader` class that reads the header of a frame in the RLPx network protocol used by Ethereum clients.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `DotNetty.Buffers` and `Nethermind.Serialization.Rlp` namespaces.

3. What is the significance of the `currentContextId` field?
   - The `currentContextId` field is used to keep track of the context ID of the current frame being read. It is set to `null` if the frame does not have a context ID, and is used to determine if a frame is chunked or not.
