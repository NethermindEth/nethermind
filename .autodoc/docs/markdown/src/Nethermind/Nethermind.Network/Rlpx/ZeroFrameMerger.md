The `ZeroFrameMerger` class is a decoder that merges RLPx frames into a single `ZeroPacket`. The `ZeroPacket` is a data structure that represents a message in the RLPx protocol. The RLPx protocol is a peer-to-peer networking protocol used by Ethereum clients to communicate with each other. The `ZeroFrameMerger` class is used to decode incoming RLPx frames and merge them into a single `ZeroPacket` that can be processed by the rest of the RLPx protocol stack.

The `ZeroFrameMerger` class extends the `ByteToMessageDecoder` class from the DotNetty library. The `ByteToMessageDecoder` class is a base class for decoders that decode incoming bytes into messages. The `Decode` method is called by the DotNetty framework for each incoming byte buffer. The `Decode` method reads the incoming byte buffer and merges it into a `ZeroPacket`. If the incoming byte buffer contains a complete `ZeroPacket`, the `ZeroPacket` is added to the output list. If the incoming byte buffer contains an incomplete `ZeroPacket`, the `Decode` method waits for more data to arrive.

The `ZeroFrameMerger` class uses a `FrameHeaderReader` to read the frame header from the incoming byte buffer. The frame header contains information about the size and type of the incoming frame. If the incoming frame is the first frame of a `ZeroPacket`, the `ReadFirstChunk` method is called to read the packet type and allocate a buffer for the `ZeroPacket` content. If the incoming frame is not the first frame of a `ZeroPacket`, the `ReadChunk` method is called to read the frame content into the `ZeroPacket` buffer.

The `ZeroFrameMerger` class is used by the RLPx protocol stack to decode incoming RLPx frames. The `ZeroPacket` is then processed by the rest of the RLPx protocol stack to handle the message. The `ZeroFrameMerger` class is an important part of the RLPx protocol stack because it ensures that incoming RLPx frames are correctly merged into `ZeroPackets` that can be processed by the rest of the protocol stack.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ZeroFrameMerger` class?
    
    The `ZeroFrameMerger` class is a decoder that merges RLPx frames into a single `ZeroPacket` object.

2. What is the `IllegalReferenceCountException` and when is it thrown?
    
    The `IllegalReferenceCountException` is thrown when the reference count of the input buffer is not equal to 1.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetPacketType` method?
    
    The `GetPacketType` method returns the packet type of the `ZeroPacket` object based on the RLP-encoded packet type byte. If the byte is 128, it returns 0.
