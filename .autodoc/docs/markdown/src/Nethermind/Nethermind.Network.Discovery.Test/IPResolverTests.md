The `IPResolverTests` class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the `IPResolver` class in the Nethermind project. The `IPResolver` class is responsible for resolving the external and local IP addresses of the machine running the Nethermind node. 

The `Can_resolve_external_ip` method tests whether the `IPResolver` class can successfully resolve the external IP address of the machine. It creates a new instance of the `IPResolver` class, initializes it, and then retrieves the external IP address using the `ExternalIp` property. Finally, it asserts that the retrieved IP address is not null.

The `Can_resolve_external_ip_with_override` method tests whether the `IPResolver` class can successfully resolve the external IP address of the machine when an override IP address is provided. It creates a new instance of the `IPResolver` class with an `INetworkConfig` object that has the `ExternalIp` property set to the override IP address. It then initializes the `IPResolver` object and retrieves the external IP address using the `ExternalIp` property. Finally, it asserts that the retrieved IP address is equal to the override IP address.

The `Can_resolve_internal_ip` method tests whether the `IPResolver` class can successfully resolve the local IP address of the machine. It creates a new instance of the `IPResolver` class, initializes it, and then retrieves the local IP address using the `LocalIp` property. Finally, it asserts that the retrieved IP address is not null.

The `Can_resolve_local_ip_with_override` method tests whether the `IPResolver` class can successfully resolve the local IP address of the machine when an override IP address is provided. It creates a new instance of the `IPResolver` class with an `INetworkConfig` object that has the `LocalIp` property set to the override IP address. It then initializes the `IPResolver` object and retrieves the local IP address using the `LocalIp` property. Finally, it asserts that the retrieved IP address is equal to the override IP address.

These tests ensure that the `IPResolver` class is functioning correctly and can accurately resolve the external and local IP addresses of the machine running the Nethermind node. The `IPResolver` class is an important component of the Nethermind project as it is used to identify the IP address of the machine running the node, which is necessary for communication with other nodes on the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IPResolver` class?
- The `IPResolver` class is used to resolve the external and local IP addresses of a network.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `IPResolverTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `IPResolverTests` class can be run in parallel.

3. What is the purpose of the `LimboLogs` class?
- The `LimboLogs` class is used for logging in the `IPResolverTests` class.
