The `EnvConfigSource` class is a configuration source that retrieves configuration values from environment variables. It implements the `IConfigSource` interface, which defines methods for retrieving configuration values. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to configure the Nethermind project using environment variables.

The `EnvConfigSource` class has two constructors. The first constructor creates a new instance of the `EnvConfigSource` class using the default `EnvironmentWrapper`. The second constructor allows the caller to provide a custom implementation of the `IEnvironment` interface. This is useful for testing or for providing a custom environment implementation.

The `GetValue` method retrieves a configuration value of a specified type, category, and name. It calls the `GetRawValue` method to retrieve the raw value of the configuration variable from the environment. If the raw value is not set, it returns the default value for the specified type. If the raw value is set, it parses the raw value to the specified type using the `ConfigSourceHelper.ParseValue` method.

The `GetRawValue` method retrieves the raw value of a configuration variable from the environment. It constructs the environment variable name based on the category and name parameters. If the environment variable is not set, it returns a tuple with `false` and `null`. If the environment variable is set, it returns a tuple with `true` and the value of the environment variable.

The `GetConfigKeys` method retrieves all the configuration keys that start with "NETHERMIND_" from the environment. It returns an enumerable of tuples with the category and name of each configuration key. If the configuration key does not have a category, the category value is `null`.

The `IEnvironment` interface defines methods for retrieving environment variables and exiting the application. The `EnvironmentWrapper` class is a concrete implementation of the `IEnvironment` interface that wraps the `Environment` class. It provides a way to mock the environment for testing purposes.

Overall, the `EnvConfigSource` class provides a way to configure the Nethermind project using environment variables. It is a flexible and extensible way to configure the project, and it can be easily customized for different environments or testing scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EnvConfigSource` class?
    
    The `EnvConfigSource` class is a configuration source that retrieves configuration values from environment variables.

2. What is the purpose of the `IEnvironment` interface and the `EnvironmentWrapper` class?
    
    The `IEnvironment` interface and the `EnvironmentWrapper` class provide an abstraction layer for accessing environment variables, allowing for easier testing and mocking of the environment.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetConfigKeys` method?
    
    The `GetConfigKeys` method returns a list of all the configuration keys that are available in the environment, along with their categories.
