The `TestLoader` class is a utility class that provides methods for loading and preparing test data from JSON files. It is part of the Ethereum.Test.Base namespace and is used in the Nethermind project to facilitate testing of Ethereum-related functionality.

The `PrepareInput` method takes an object as input and returns a modified version of that object. If the input is a string that starts with the "#" character, it is assumed to be a hexadecimal number and is converted to a `BigInteger`. If the input is a `JArray`, each element of the array is recursively passed through the `PrepareInput` method. If the input is a `JToken` that represents a string or an integer, the corresponding value is returned. Otherwise, the input is returned unchanged.

The `LoadFromFile` method takes two type parameters, `TContainer` and `TTest`, and a string parameter `testFileName`. It also takes a delegate parameter `testExtractor` that is used to extract test data from the deserialized JSON object. The method first retrieves the manifest resource names for the assembly that contains the `TTest` type. It then searches for a resource name that contains the `testFileName` string. If such a resource is found, the method opens a stream to that resource and reads its contents into a string variable. The string is then deserialized into an object of type `TContainer`. The `testExtractor` delegate is then called with the deserialized object as input, and the resulting `IEnumerable<TTest>` is returned.

Overall, the `TestLoader` class provides a convenient way to load and prepare test data from JSON files in the Nethermind project. It is used in conjunction with other testing utilities to ensure that Ethereum-related functionality is working correctly. Here is an example usage of the `LoadFromFile` method:

```csharp
IEnumerable<MyTest> tests = TestLoader.LoadFromFile<MyTestContainer, MyTest>(
    "my_test_file.json",
    container => container.Tests);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PrepareInput` method?
- The `PrepareInput` method is used to convert input data into the appropriate format for testing.

2. What is the purpose of the `LoadFromFile` method?
- The `LoadFromFile` method is used to load test data from a file and extract test cases using a provided function.

3. What is the purpose of the `NUnit.Framework` namespace?
- The `NUnit.Framework` namespace is used to provide support for writing and running NUnit tests.
