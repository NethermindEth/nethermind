The `FileTestsSource` class is a utility class that provides methods for loading Ethereum tests from files. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to load tests from files in a standardized way, so that they can be easily integrated into the larger Ethereum test suite.

The class has two main methods: `LoadGeneralStateTests` and `LoadBlockchainTests`. Both methods take no arguments and return an `IEnumerable` of test objects. The `LoadGeneralStateTests` method loads tests that are designed to test the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the `LoadBlockchainTests` method loads tests that are designed to test the Ethereum blockchain.

The `FileTestsSource` class takes two arguments in its constructor: `fileName` and `wildcard`. The `fileName` argument is the name of the file that contains the tests, and the `wildcard` argument is an optional string that can be used to filter the tests that are loaded. If `wildcard` is not null, only tests whose file names contain the `wildcard` string will be loaded.

The `LoadGeneralStateTests` and `LoadBlockchainTests` methods first check if the file name starts with a dot (`.`). If it does, it returns an empty `IEnumerable`. This is to avoid loading hidden files that may be present in the directory.

Next, if the `wildcard` argument is not null and the file name does not contain the `wildcard` string, it returns an empty `IEnumerable`. This is to allow filtering of tests based on a pattern.

Finally, the methods read the contents of the file using `File.ReadAllText` and pass the resulting JSON string to a `JsonToEthereumTest` class to convert it to a test object. If an exception occurs during this process, the methods return a single test object with a `LoadFailure` property that contains the error message.

Overall, the `FileTestsSource` class provides a simple and flexible way to load Ethereum tests from files, which can be used to test the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Ethereum blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadGeneralStateTests` method?
   - The `LoadGeneralStateTests` method is used to load and convert JSON files to `GeneralStateTest` objects.
2. What is the purpose of the `_wildcard` field?
   - The `_wildcard` field is an optional parameter that can be used to filter the files to be loaded based on a specific pattern.
3. What happens if an exception is thrown while loading the tests?
   - If an exception is thrown while loading the tests, the method returns a single test object with the name of the file and the exception message as the `LoadFailure` property.
