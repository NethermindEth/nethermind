The `TestsSourceLoader` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to load Ethereum tests from a specified path. It implements the `ITestSourceLoader` interface which defines a method to load tests. The class takes in three parameters: an instance of `ITestLoadStrategy`, a string representing the path to the test files, and an optional string representing a wildcard pattern to filter the test files.

The `LoadTests` method is the main method of the class and returns an `IEnumerable` of `IEthereumTest` objects. It calls the `Load` method of the `_testLoadStrategy` object, passing in the path and wildcard parameters. The `_testLoadStrategy` object is responsible for actually loading the test files and returning a collection of `IEthereumTest` objects.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way to load Ethereum tests from a specified path. The `ITestLoadStrategy` interface allows for different strategies to be used for loading tests, depending on the needs of the project. For example, one strategy may load tests from a local directory, while another may load tests from a remote server.

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the Nethermind project:

```
ITestLoadStrategy loadStrategy = new LocalTestLoadStrategy();
string path = "C:/EthereumTests";
string wildcard = "*.json";
TestsSourceLoader loader = new TestsSourceLoader(loadStrategy, path, wildcard);
IEnumerable<IEthereumTest> tests = loader.LoadTests();
```

In this example, a `LocalTestLoadStrategy` object is used to load tests from a local directory at `C:/EthereumTests`. The `TestsSourceLoader` object is then created with the `loadStrategy`, `path`, and `wildcard` parameters. Finally, the `LoadTests` method is called to load the tests and return them as an `IEnumerable` of `IEthereumTest` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TestsSourceLoader` class?
   - The `TestsSourceLoader` class is responsible for loading Ethereum tests from a specified path using a given load strategy.

2. What is the significance of the `ITestSourceLoader` interface?
   - The `TestsSourceLoader` class implements the `ITestSourceLoader` interface, which defines the contract for loading Ethereum tests.

3. What is the role of the `_wildcard` parameter in the constructor?
   - The `_wildcard` parameter is an optional parameter that allows for filtering the tests to be loaded based on a specified pattern. If no pattern is specified, all tests in the specified path will be loaded.
