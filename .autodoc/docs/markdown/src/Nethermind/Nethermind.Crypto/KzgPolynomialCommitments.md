The `KzgPolynomialCommitments` class is a utility class that provides methods for computing and verifying polynomial commitments using the KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) scheme. The KZG scheme is a zero-knowledge proof system that allows a prover to commit to a polynomial and later prove that a given value is a polynomial evaluation at a specific point without revealing any information about the polynomial itself.

The class provides the following public methods:

- `Initialize`: This method loads the trusted setup parameters for the KZG scheme from a file and initializes the internal state of the class. The method is thread-safe and can be called multiple times without causing any issues. The method returns a `Task` that completes when the initialization is done.
- `TryComputeCommitmentV1`: This method computes a hash of a given polynomial commitment and returns the result in a buffer. The method takes two parameters: `commitment`, which is a read-only span of bytes representing the commitment, and `hashBuffer`, which is a span of bytes that will hold the output hash. The method returns `true` if the computation was successful and `false` otherwise.
- `VerifyProof`: This method verifies a KZG proof for a given commitment, point, and value. The method takes four parameters: `commitment`, which is a read-only span of bytes representing the commitment, `z`, which is a read-only span of bytes representing the point, `y`, which is a read-only span of bytes representing the value, and `proof`, which is a read-only span of bytes representing the KZG proof. The method returns `true` if the proof is valid and `false` otherwise.
- `AreProofsValid`: This method verifies a batch of KZG proofs for a given set of commitments, points, and values. The method takes three parameters: `blobs`, which is an array of bytes representing the commitments and values interleaved, `commitments`, which is an array of bytes representing the commitments, and `proofs`, which is an array of bytes representing the KZG proofs. The method returns `true` if all the proofs are valid and `false` otherwise.

The class also defines some constants and private fields that are used internally. The `BlsModulus` field represents the modulus used in the KZG scheme and is a constant value defined in the EIP-4844 specification. The `KzgBlobHashVersionV1` and `BytesPerBlobVersionedHash` constants are used to define the format of the hash computed by the `TryComputeCommitmentV1` method. The `_ckzgSetup` field is a pointer to the trusted setup parameters loaded by the `Initialize` method. The `_sha256` field is a thread-local instance of the SHA256 hash algorithm used by the `TryComputeCommitmentV1` method.

Overall, the `KzgPolynomialCommitments` class provides a convenient and efficient way to compute and verify polynomial commitments using the KZG scheme. The class can be used in various parts of the Nethermind project that require zero-knowledge proofs or polynomial commitments, such as the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `KzgPolynomialCommitments` class?
    
    The `KzgPolynomialCommitments` class provides methods for computing and verifying polynomial commitments using the CKZG scheme.

2. What is the `BlsModulus` field used for?
    
    The `BlsModulus` field is a constant representing the modulus used in the BLS12-381 elliptic curve pairing used by the CKZG scheme.

3. What is the purpose of the `Initialize` method?
    
    The `Initialize` method loads the trusted setup for the CKZG scheme from a file and initializes the `_ckzgSetup` field with the loaded data. It is called automatically the first time any of the other methods in the class are called.
