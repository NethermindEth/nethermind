The `StatementHistoryManagerTests` class is a test suite for the `StatementHistoryManager` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to test the functionality of the `StatementHistoryManager` class, which is responsible for managing the command history of the Nethermind CLI console.

The `SetUp` method is called before each test and initializes the `_console`, `_fileSystem`, `_file`, and `_historyManager` variables. The `ReadLine.ClearHistory()` method is called to clear the command history before each test.

The `should_write_removed_to_history_if_secured_command_received` test method tests the behavior of the `UpdateHistory` method when a secured command is received. The test creates a mock file system and file object and sets up the mock file object to return `true` when the `Exists` method is called. The `AppendAllLines` method is set up to add the received command to the `fileContents` list. The `UpdateHistory` method is called with a non-secured command, and the `fileContents` and command history are checked to ensure that the command was added. The `UpdateHistory` method is then called with a secured command, and the `fileContents` and command history are checked to ensure that the secured command was replaced with `*removed*`. The test repeats this process with additional commands to ensure that the command history is updated correctly.

The `Init_should_read_history_from_file` test method tests the behavior of the `Init` method when the command history file exists. The test sets up the mock file object to return `true` when the `Exists` method is called and to return a list of strings when the `ReadLines` method is called. The `Init` method is called, and the command history is checked to ensure that it matches the contents of the file.

Overall, the `StatementHistoryManagerTests` class tests the functionality of the `StatementHistoryManager` class and ensures that it correctly manages the command history of the Nethermind CLI console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StatementHistoryManager` class?
- The `StatementHistoryManager` class is responsible for managing the command history of a CLI console.

2. What is the significance of the `should_write_removed_to_history_if_secured_command_received` test?
- The `should_write_removed_to_history_if_secured_command_received` test checks if the `StatementHistoryManager` correctly replaces secured commands with `*removed*` in the command history.

3. What is the purpose of the `Init` method in the `StatementHistoryManager` class?
- The `Init` method reads the command history from a file and initializes the command history of the CLI console with the contents of the file.
