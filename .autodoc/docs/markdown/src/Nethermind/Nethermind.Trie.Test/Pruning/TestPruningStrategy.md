The code above defines a class called `TestPruningStrategy` that implements the `IPruningStrategy` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a strategy for pruning tries in the Nethermind project. 

The `TestPruningStrategy` class has two constructor parameters: `pruningEnabled` and `shouldPrune`. The `pruningEnabled` parameter is a boolean that determines whether pruning is enabled or not. The `shouldPrune` parameter is also a boolean that determines whether pruning should be performed or not. 

The class has three properties: `PruningEnabled`, `ShouldPruneEnabled`, and `WithMemoryLimit`. The `PruningEnabled` property returns the value of the `pruningEnabled` parameter passed to the constructor. The `ShouldPruneEnabled` property gets or sets the value of the `shouldPrune` parameter passed to the constructor. The `WithMemoryLimit` property gets or sets the memory limit for pruning. 

The class also has a method called `ShouldPrune` that takes in a `long` parameter called `currentMemory`. This method returns a boolean that determines whether pruning should be performed or not. If `pruningEnabled` is false, the method returns false. If `shouldPrune` is true, the method returns true. If `WithMemoryLimit` is not null and `currentMemory` is greater than `WithMemoryLimit`, the method returns true. Otherwise, the method returns false. 

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a strategy for pruning tries. The `TestPruningStrategy` class can be instantiated with different values for the `pruningEnabled`, `shouldPrune`, and `WithMemoryLimit` parameters to provide different pruning strategies. For example, if `pruningEnabled` is true and `shouldPrune` is false, pruning will only be performed if the memory limit is exceeded. If `pruningEnabled` is false, pruning will never be performed. 

Overall, the `TestPruningStrategy` class provides a flexible way to implement pruning strategies for tries in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class called `TestPruningStrategy` that implements the `IPruningStrategy` interface from the `Nethermind.Trie.Pruning` namespace. It provides a way to enable or disable pruning and set memory limits for pruning.
   
2. What are the parameters of the `TestPruningStrategy` constructor and what do they do?
   - The `TestPruningStrategy` constructor takes in two boolean parameters: `pruningEnabled` and `shouldPrune`. `pruningEnabled` determines whether pruning is enabled or not, while `shouldPrune` determines whether pruning should be done or not.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `ShouldPrune` method and how does it work?
   - The `ShouldPrune` method determines whether pruning should be done based on the current memory usage and the values of `pruningEnabled`, `shouldPrune`, and `WithMemoryLimit`. If `pruningEnabled` is false, pruning is not done. If `shouldPrune` is true, pruning is done. If `WithMemoryLimit` is set and the current memory usage is greater than the limit, pruning is done. Otherwise, pruning is not done.
