The `DocsDirFinder` class is a utility class that provides two static methods for finding the directory path of the documentation and runner directories in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to locate these directories without having to hardcode their paths in the code.

The `FindDocsDir` method uses the `Environment.CurrentDirectory` property to get the current working directory and then searches for a directory named "docs" in the current directory and its parent directories. It uses the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` method to enumerate all directories in the current directory that match the "docs" pattern and returns the first match found. If no match is found, it moves up to the parent directory and repeats the process until it reaches the root directory.

The `FindRunnerDir` method also uses the `Environment.CurrentDirectory` property to get the current working directory and then searches for a directory named "Nethermind.Runner" in the current directory and its parent directories. It uses the `Directory.GetDirectories` method to get all directories in the current directory and checks if any of them match the "Nethermind.Runner" pattern. If a match is found, it returns the full path of the directory. If no match is found, it moves up to the parent directory and repeats the process until it reaches the root directory.

These methods can be used in the larger Nethermind project to locate the documentation and runner directories dynamically at runtime. For example, the `FindDocsDir` method can be used to load documentation files or resources from the documentation directory, while the `FindRunnerDir` method can be used to locate the Nethermind.Runner executable or configuration files. By using these methods, the project can be more flexible and portable, as the directory paths can be changed without affecting the code that depends on them.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a static class called `DocsDirFinder` that contains two methods: `FindDocsDir()` and `FindRunnerDir()`. These methods search for specific directories within the current directory and its parent directories.

2. What is the expected output of `FindDocsDir()`?
- The expected output of `FindDocsDir()` is a string representing the path to the "docs" directory within the current directory or one of its parent directories. If the directory is not found, the method returns null.

3. What is the expected output of `FindRunnerDir()`?
- The expected output of `FindRunnerDir()` is a string representing the path to the "Nethermind.Runner" directory within the current directory or one of its parent directories. If the directory is not found, the method returns null.
