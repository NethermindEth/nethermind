The `EnrRequestMsgSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing `EnrRequestMsg` objects, which are used in the Nethermind project for peer discovery. 

The `EnrRequestMsg` class represents a message requesting an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) from a peer. An ENR is a signed record containing metadata about a node, such as its IP address, port, and supported protocols. The `EnrRequestMsg` message contains an expiration time for the requested ENR.

The `EnrRequestMsgSerializer` class implements the `IZeroInnerMessageSerializer` interface, which defines methods for serializing and deserializing messages that do not have an inner message. The class also extends the `DiscoveryMsgSerializerBase` class, which provides common functionality for serializing and deserializing discovery messages.

The `Serialize` method takes an `EnrRequestMsg` object and a `IByteBuffer` object and serializes the message into the buffer. The method first calculates the length of the message and prepares the buffer for serialization. It then encodes the message's expiration time using RLP encoding and adds the signature and message authentication code (MDC) to the buffer.

The `Deserialize` method takes a `IByteBuffer` object and deserializes it into an `EnrRequestMsg` object. The method first prepares the buffer for deserialization by extracting the public key, MDC, and data from the buffer. It then decodes the expiration time from the data using RLP decoding and creates a new `EnrRequestMsg` object with the decoded expiration time and the extracted public key.

The `GetLength` method takes an `EnrRequestMsg` object and calculates the length of the message. It first calculates the length of the encoded expiration time using RLP encoding and then calculates the length of the RLP sequence containing the expiration time.

Overall, the `EnrRequestMsgSerializer` class provides functionality for serializing and deserializing `EnrRequestMsg` objects, which are used in the Nethermind project for peer discovery. The class uses RLP encoding to encode and decode the message's expiration time and provides methods for calculating the length of the message.
## Questions:
