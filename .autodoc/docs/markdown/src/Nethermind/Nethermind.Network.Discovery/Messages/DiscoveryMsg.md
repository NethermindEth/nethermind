The code defines an abstract class called `DiscoveryMsg` that serves as a base class for messages used in the Nethermind network discovery protocol. The purpose of this protocol is to allow nodes to discover and connect to each other in a decentralized manner.

The `DiscoveryMsg` class has several properties and methods that are used by the protocol. The `FarAddress` property represents the IP address and port of the remote node that sent the message. The `FarPublicKey` property represents the public key of the remote node, which is used to verify the signature of the message. The `Version` property represents the version of the protocol used by the message. The `ExpirationTime` property represents the time at which the message will expire and should no longer be considered valid.

The class has two constructors that take different parameters. The first constructor takes an `IPEndPoint` object representing the far address of the remote node and an expiration time. The second constructor takes a `PublicKey` object representing the far public key of the remote node and an expiration time. The `FarAddress` and `FarPublicKey` properties are set accordingly.

The class also has an abstract `MsgType` property that represents the type of the message. This property is implemented by derived classes that represent specific message types.

The `ToString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the message that includes the message type, far address, far public key, and expiration time.

Overall, this code provides a base class for messages used in the Nethermind network discovery protocol. It defines properties and methods that are used by the protocol to discover and connect to other nodes in a decentralized manner. The class can be extended by derived classes that represent specific message types. For example, a `Ping` message type could be defined that derives from `DiscoveryMsg` and includes additional properties and methods specific to the `Ping` message type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Messages namespace?
- The namespace contains a class called DiscoveryMsg which is an abstract base class for messages used in network discovery.

2. What is the significance of the FarPublicKey property being nullable?
- If the FarPublicKey property is null, it suggests that the signature is not correct.

3. What is the default value of the Version property?
- The default value of the Version property is 4.
