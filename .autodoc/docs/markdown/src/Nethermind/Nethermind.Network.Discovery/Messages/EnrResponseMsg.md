The `EnrResponseMsg` class is a message type used in the Nethermind project's network discovery protocol. It represents a response to an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 868 request, which is a request for a Node Record (ENR) from another node on the network. 

The `EnrResponseMsg` class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class, which is a base class for all messages in the network discovery protocol. It contains two constructors that take different parameters: one takes an `IPEndPoint` object representing the far address of the node that sent the request, and the other takes a `PublicKey` object representing the public key of the far node. Both constructors also take a `NodeRecord` object representing the ENR of the node that is sending the response, and a `Keccak` object representing the hash of the request message.

The `NodeRecord` property is a getter that returns the ENR of the node that is sending the response. The `RequestKeccak` property is a getter and setter that returns and sets the hash of the request message.

Overall, the `EnrResponseMsg` class is a key component of the Nethermind project's network discovery protocol, allowing nodes to request and receive ENRs from other nodes on the network. It implements the EIP-868 standard for requesting ENRs, and provides a standardized way for nodes to respond to those requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file contains a class called `EnrResponseMsg` which represents a message used in the Nethermind network discovery protocol, specifically for responding to an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 868 request.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxTime` constant?
   - The `MaxTime` constant is used to set the expiration time of the message to the maximum possible value, indicating that the message does not expire.

3. What is the `NodeRecord` property and how is it used?
   - The `NodeRecord` property is a reference to a `NodeRecord` object, which contains information about a node in the Nethermind network. It is used to provide the node's information in the response message.
