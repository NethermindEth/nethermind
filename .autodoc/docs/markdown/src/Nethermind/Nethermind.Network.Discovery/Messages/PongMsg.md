The code defines a class called `PongMsg` which is a message used in the Nethermind network discovery protocol. The purpose of this message is to respond to a `PingMsg` message sent by another node in the network. The `PongMsg` message contains a `PingMdc` field which is a hash of the `PingMsg` message. This allows the sender of the `PingMsg` to verify that the response they received is indeed a response to their original message.

The `PongMsg` class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class which contains common fields and methods used in all discovery messages. The `PongMsg` class has two constructors which take different parameters to create a new instance of the class. The first constructor takes an `IPEndPoint` object representing the address of the node that sent the `PingMsg`, a `long` value representing the expiration time of the message, and a `byte[]` array representing the hash of the `PingMsg`. The second constructor takes a `PublicKey` object representing the public key of the node that sent the `PingMsg`, a `long` value representing the expiration time of the message, and a `byte[]` array representing the hash of the `PingMsg`.

The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `PongMsg` object. It returns a string that includes the base string representation of the `DiscoveryMsg` object and the `PingMdc` field represented as a hexadecimal string.

The `MsgType` property is also overridden to return `MsgType.Pong` which is an enum value representing the type of the message.

Overall, the `PongMsg` class is an important part of the Nethermind network discovery protocol as it allows nodes to communicate with each other and verify the authenticity of messages. An example usage of this class would be when a node sends a `PingMsg` to another node to check if it is still online and receives a `PongMsg` response with the same `PingMdc` hash. This would confirm that the node is still online and responding to messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PongMsg` class?
- The `PongMsg` class is a subclass of `DiscoveryMsg` and represents a message used in network discovery.
2. What is the significance of the `PingMdc` property?
- The `PingMdc` property is a byte array that represents the message digest of a ping message. It is used in the construction of a `PongMsg` object.
3. What is the `ToString()` method used for?
- The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of a `PongMsg` object, including the `PingMdc` property value.
