The `FindNodeMsg` class is a message type used in the Nethermind project's network discovery protocol. This protocol is used to discover other nodes on the network and exchange information about them. The `FindNodeMsg` message is used to request information about nodes that match a certain criteria, specified by the `SearchedNodeId` property.

The `FindNodeMsg` class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class, which provides common functionality for all discovery messages. The `FindNodeMsg` class adds the `SearchedNodeId` property, which is a byte array representing the ID of the node being searched for. The `ToString` method is overridden to include the `SearchedNodeId` property in the message string representation.

The `FindNodeMsg` class has two constructors, one that takes an `IPEndPoint` and one that takes a `PublicKey`. Both constructors take a `long` expiration date and a `byte[]` representing the `SearchedNodeId`. The `IPEndPoint` constructor is used when sending a message to a specific endpoint, while the `PublicKey` constructor is used when sending a message to a specific node identified by its public key.

Overall, the `FindNodeMsg` class is an important part of the Nethermind network discovery protocol, allowing nodes to search for and discover other nodes on the network. Here is an example of how the `FindNodeMsg` class might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
// create a new FindNodeMsg to search for nodes with a specific ID
byte[] searchedNodeId = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
FindNodeMsg findNodeMsg = new FindNodeMsg(remoteEndpoint, expirationDate, searchedNodeId);

// send the message to the remote endpoint
await discoveryProtocol.SendAsync(findNodeMsg);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FindNodeMsg` class?
    
    The `FindNodeMsg` class is a subclass of `DiscoveryMsg` and represents a message used in the network discovery protocol to find nodes with a specific ID.

2. What is the significance of the `SearchedNodeId` property?
    
    The `SearchedNodeId` property is a byte array that represents the ID of the node being searched for in the network discovery protocol.

3. What is the relationship between the `FindNodeMsg` class and other classes in the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Messages` namespace?
    
    The `FindNodeMsg` class is a part of the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Messages` namespace and is a subclass of the `DiscoveryMsg` class, which is also located in the same namespace. It is likely that other classes in this namespace are also related to the network discovery protocol.
