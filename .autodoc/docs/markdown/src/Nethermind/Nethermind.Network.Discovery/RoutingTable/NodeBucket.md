The `NodeBucket` class is a component of the Nethermind project's network discovery and routing table functionality. It represents a bucket of nodes at a particular distance from the master node. The purpose of this class is to manage the nodes in the bucket, including adding, replacing, and refreshing nodes.

The class contains a constructor that takes two parameters: `distance` and `bucketSize`. The `distance` parameter represents the distance from the master node, while the `bucketSize` parameter represents the maximum number of nodes that can be stored in the bucket.

The `NodeBucket` class contains a private field `_items` that is a linked list of `NodeBucketItem` objects. The `NodeBucketItem` class represents a node in the bucket and contains information such as the node's IP address, port, and last contact time.

The `NodeBucket` class provides several methods for managing the nodes in the bucket. The `AddNode` method adds a node to the bucket. If the bucket is not full, the node is added to the beginning of the linked list. If the bucket is full, the `GetEvictionCandidate` method is called to select a node to evict from the bucket. The `ReplaceNode` method replaces an existing node in the bucket with a new node. The `RefreshNode` method updates the last contact time for a node in the bucket.

The `NodeBucket` class also provides properties for accessing information about the nodes in the bucket. The `BondedItems` property returns an enumerable collection of `NodeBucketItem` objects that are currently bonded (i.e., have been contacted recently). The `BondedItemsCount` property returns the number of bonded items in the bucket.

Finally, the `NodeBucket` class contains a private field `_nodeBucketLock` that is used to synchronize access to the linked list of nodes. This ensures that multiple threads cannot modify the list simultaneously, which could result in data corruption.

Overall, the `NodeBucket` class is an important component of the Nethermind project's network discovery and routing table functionality. It provides a way to manage nodes in a bucket at a particular distance from the master node, including adding, replacing, and refreshing nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeBucket` class?
    
    The `NodeBucket` class is used for managing a bucket of nodes in a routing table for network discovery.

2. What is the significance of the `BondedItems` property?
    
    The `BondedItems` property returns an enumerable collection of `NodeBucketItem` objects that are considered "bonded", meaning they have been contacted recently and are considered active.

3. What is the purpose of the `RefreshNode` method?
    
    The `RefreshNode` method updates the timestamp of a `NodeBucketItem` object in the bucket to indicate that the node has been contacted recently, and moves the item to the front of the bucket.
