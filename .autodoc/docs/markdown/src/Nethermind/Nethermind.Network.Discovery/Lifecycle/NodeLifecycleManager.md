The `NodeLifecycleManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a node in the discovery network. It implements the `INodeLifecycleManager` interface and provides methods for processing various messages received from other nodes in the network. 

The class has several private fields, including instances of other classes such as `IDiscoveryManager`, `INodeTable`, `ILogger`, `IEvictionManager`, `NodeRecord`, `IDiscoveryConfig`, and `ITimestamper`. These fields are used to manage the node's state and to communicate with other nodes in the network.

The class has a constructor that takes several parameters, including a `Node` object, which represents the node being managed, and instances of the other classes mentioned above. The constructor initializes the private fields and sets the node's state to `New`.

The class has several public properties, including `ManagedNode`, which returns the node being managed, `State`, which returns the current state of the node, and `NodeStats`, which provides statistics about the node's activity in the network.

The class has several public methods, including `ProcessPingMsg`, which processes a `PingMsg` received from another node, `ProcessEnrResponseMsg`, which processes an `EnrResponseMsg` received from another node, `ProcessPongMsg`, which processes a `PongMsg` received from another node, `ProcessNeighborsMsg`, which processes a `NeighborsMsg` received from another node, and `ProcessFindNodeMsg`, which processes a `FindNodeMsg` received from another node. 

The class also has several private methods, including `SendEnrRequest`, which sends an `EnrRequestMsg` to another node, `SendPong`, which sends a `PongMsg` to another node, `SendNeighbors`, which sends a `NeighborsMsg` to another node, and `CreateAndSendPingAsync`, which creates and sends a `PingMsg` to another node.

The `NodeLifecycleManager` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's discovery network. It manages the state of nodes in the network and facilitates communication between them. It provides a way for nodes to discover each other and exchange information, which is essential for the proper functioning of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeLifecycleManager` class?
- The `NodeLifecycleManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a node in the discovery network, including sending and receiving messages, updating node state, and handling eviction.

2. What is the significance of the `IsBonded` property?
- The `IsBonded` property indicates whether the node has successfully completed the bonding process with another node in the network, which requires exchanging ping and pong messages.

3. What is the purpose of the `RefreshNodeContactTime` method?
- The `RefreshNodeContactTime` method updates the last contact time for the managed node in the node table, which is used to determine whether a node should be evicted from the network due to inactivity.
