The `EvictionManager` class is responsible for managing the eviction process of nodes in the Nethermind network. It is used to remove nodes that are no longer responsive or have been deemed unreliable and replace them with new nodes. The class is part of the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Lifecycle` namespace.

The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: an `INodeTable` and an `ILogManager`. The `INodeTable` is used to replace the evicted node with a new node, while the `ILogManager` is used to log the eviction process. The class implements the `IEvictionManager` interface.

The class has a single public method called `StartEvictionProcess`, which takes two parameters: an `INodeLifecycleManager` object representing the node to be evicted, and an `INodeLifecycleManager` object representing the replacement node. When this method is called, a new `EvictionPair` object is created with the two nodes, and the pair is added to a `ConcurrentDictionary` called `_evictionPairs`. If there is already an eviction process in progress for the same node, the method returns without doing anything. Otherwise, the `StartEvictionProcess` method of the `evictionCandidate` is called, and an event handler is attached to the `OnStateChanged` event of the `evictionCandidate`.

The `OnStateChange` method is called when the state of the `evictionCandidate` changes. If the state is `NodeLifecycleState.Active`, it means that the node has survived the eviction process, and the `replacementCandidate` is notified that it has lost the eviction process. If the state is `NodeLifecycleState.Unreachable`, it means that the node has been evicted, and the `evictionCandidate` is replaced with the `replacementCandidate` in the `nodeTable`. In both cases, the eviction process is closed by removing the `evictionCandidate` from the `_evictionPairs` dictionary and detaching the event handler from the `OnStateChanged` event.

Overall, the `EvictionManager` class is an important part of the Nethermind network's discovery process, ensuring that unreliable or unresponsive nodes are removed and replaced with new nodes. It provides a way to manage the eviction process and log the results. An example of how this class might be used in the larger project is in the `DiscoveryService` class, which is responsible for discovering new nodes and managing the network's peer-to-peer connections. The `EvictionManager` class is used by the `DiscoveryService` class to manage the eviction process of nodes that are no longer responsive or reliable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EvictionManager class?
    
    The EvictionManager class is responsible for managing the eviction process of nodes in the Nethermind network.

2. What is the significance of the ConcurrentDictionary used in this code?
    
    The ConcurrentDictionary is used to store the eviction pairs of nodes and ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying the dictionary.

3. What is the relationship between the EvictionManager and the INodeLifecycleManager interface?
    
    The EvictionManager uses the INodeLifecycleManager interface to start and manage the eviction process of nodes. The OnStateChanged event of the INodeLifecycleManager interface is also used to handle changes in the state of the node during the eviction process.
