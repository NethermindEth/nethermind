The `StandardConfigTests` class is responsible for validating the default values and descriptions of configuration properties in the Nethermind project. The class contains three methods, `ValidateDefaultValues()`, `ValidateDescriptions()`, and `ForEachProperty()`. 

The `ValidateDefaultValues()` method checks that the default values of all configuration properties are set correctly. It does this by calling the `ForEachProperty()` method with the `CheckDefault` action. The `CheckDefault` action checks that the default value of each property matches the expected value. If a property does not have a default value, it is skipped.

The `ValidateDescriptions()` method checks that all configuration properties have a description or are marked as hidden from documentation. It does this by calling the `ForEachProperty()` method with the `CheckDescribedOrHidden` action. The `CheckDescribedOrHidden` action checks that each property has a description or is marked as hidden from documentation. If a property does not have a description and is not marked as hidden, an `AssertionException` is thrown.

The `ForEachProperty()` method is a helper method that loops through all configuration properties in all configuration interfaces in all Nethermind assemblies. It does this by loading all Nethermind assemblies and finding all types that implement the `IConfig` interface. For each configuration interface, it finds the corresponding implementation and creates an instance of it. It then loops through all properties of the configuration interface and calls the specified action with the property and instance as arguments. 

Overall, the `StandardConfigTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's testing suite. It ensures that all configuration properties are set correctly and have appropriate descriptions. This helps to ensure that the Nethermind project is well-documented and easy to use. 

Example usage:

```csharp
[Test]
public void TestDefaultValues()
{
    StandardConfigTests.ValidateDefaultValues();
}

[Test]
public void TestDescriptions()
{
    StandardConfigTests.ValidateDescriptions();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StandardConfigTests` class?
- The `StandardConfigTests` class contains methods to validate default values and descriptions of properties for all types that implement the `IConfig` interface and are defined in the `Nethermind` DLLs.

2. What is the significance of the `ConfigItemAttribute` and `ConfigCategoryAttribute`?
- The `ConfigItemAttribute` is used to specify metadata for a configuration property, such as its default value and whether it should be disabled for CLI. The `ConfigCategoryAttribute` is used to specify metadata for a configuration category, such as whether it should be hidden from documentation.
 
3. What is the purpose of the `ForEachProperty` method?
- The `ForEachProperty` method iterates through all types that implement the `IConfig` interface and are defined in the `Nethermind` DLLs, and for each type, it verifies the properties of the type by calling the `verifier` function. The `verifier` function can be either `CheckDefault` or `CheckDescribedOrHidden`, depending on which method is being called.
