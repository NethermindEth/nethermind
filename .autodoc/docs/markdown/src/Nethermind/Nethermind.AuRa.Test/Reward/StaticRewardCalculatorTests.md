The `StaticRewardCalculatorTests` class is a test suite for the `StaticRewardCalculator` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to test the `CalculateRewards` method of the `StaticRewardCalculator` class, which calculates the rewards for a given block based on a dictionary of block numbers and their corresponding rewards. 

The `StaticRewardCalculator` class takes a dictionary of block numbers and their corresponding rewards as input and calculates the reward for a given block based on the closest block number in the dictionary that is less than or equal to the block number of the given block. If there is no such block number in the dictionary, the reward is zero. The `CalculateRewards` method takes a block as input and returns an array of `BlockReward` objects, which contain the beneficiary address and the reward amount.

The `StaticRewardCalculatorTests` class contains several test cases that test the `CalculateRewards` method for different input scenarios. The first test case tests the method for a dictionary with multiple block numbers and rewards, where the block number of the input block matches one of the block numbers in the dictionary. The second test case tests the method for a dictionary with a single block number and reward, where the block number of the input block matches the block number in the dictionary. The third test case tests the method for a null dictionary, where the reward should be zero. The fourth test case tests the method for a dictionary with a single block number and reward, where the block number of the input block does not match the block number in the dictionary. The fifth test case tests the method for an empty dictionary, where the reward should be zero.

Overall, the `StaticRewardCalculator` class and its `CalculateRewards` method are used in the Nethermind project to calculate rewards for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `StaticRewardCalculatorTests` class is used to ensure that the `CalculateRewards` method works correctly for different input scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StaticRewardCalculator` class?
- The `StaticRewardCalculator` class is used to calculate block rewards based on a dictionary of block numbers and corresponding reward amounts.

2. What is the significance of the `TestCase` attributes on the test methods?
- The `TestCase` attributes specify different input values and expected output values for the test methods, allowing for multiple test cases to be run with a single test method.

3. What is the purpose of the `FluentAssertions` namespace?
- The `FluentAssertions` namespace provides a fluent syntax for asserting the results of tests, making it easier to write and read test code.
