This code is a configuration file for a smart contract called TestNodeFilterContract. The purpose of this file is to define the parameters and settings for the TestNodeFilterContract smart contract. 

The configuration file includes several sections that define the parameters for the smart contract. The "engine" section defines the consensus algorithm that the smart contract will use. In this case, the authorityRound consensus algorithm is used with specific parameters such as the step duration, start step, and validator contract address. 

The "params" section defines various parameters for the smart contract such as the account start nonce, maximum extra data size, minimum gas limit, network ID, gas limit bound divisor, transaction permission contract address, transaction permission contract transition, and EIP1559 transition. 

The "genesis" section defines the initial state of the blockchain when the smart contract is deployed. This includes the seal, difficulty, author, timestamp, parent hash, extra data, and gas limit. 

Finally, the "accounts" section defines the initial state of the accounts on the blockchain. This includes the balance of each account and any built-in functions that are associated with the account. 

Overall, this configuration file is an essential part of the TestNodeFilterContract smart contract as it defines the parameters and settings that are necessary for the smart contract to function correctly. 

Example usage of this configuration file would be to deploy the TestNodeFilterContract smart contract on a blockchain network using the defined parameters and settings.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a configuration file for a blockchain node called TestNodeFilterContract.

2. What consensus algorithm is being used by this node?
- This node is using the authority round consensus algorithm.

3. What are the initial account balances and built-in functions defined in this node?
- The initial account balances and built-in functions are defined in the "accounts" section of the code. There are 5 accounts defined, each with a balance of 1. The built-in functions are ecrecover, sha256, ripemd160, and identity, each with their own pricing structure. Additionally, there is a contract defined at address 0xAB5b100cf7C8deFB3c8f3C48474223997A50fB13 with a bytecode value provided.
