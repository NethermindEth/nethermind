The `PermissionTxComparerTests` class is a test suite for the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class, which is responsible for comparing transactions based on their priority. The `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class is used in the Nethermind project to sort transactions in the transaction pool before they are included in a block.

The `PermissionTxComparerTests` class contains a series of test cases that test the behavior of the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class under different conditions. Each test case defines a set of transactions and an expected order for those transactions. The transactions are then sorted using the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class, and the resulting order is compared to the expected order.

The `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class takes two parameters: a whitelist of sender addresses and a dictionary of transaction priorities. The whitelist is used to filter out transactions from senders that are not allowed to send transactions. The dictionary of transaction priorities is used to prioritize transactions based on their destination address and function signature.

The `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class first filters out any transactions from senders that are not in the whitelist. It then sorts the remaining transactions based on their priority. Transactions with a higher priority are sorted before transactions with a lower priority. If two transactions have the same priority, they are sorted based on their nonce.

The `PermissionTxComparerTests` class defines a set of transactions and an expected order for those transactions. The transactions are then sorted using the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class, and the resulting order is compared to the expected order.

The `PermissionTxComparerTests` class uses the `FluentAssertions` library to make assertions about the order of the transactions. The `FluentAssertions` library provides a fluent interface for making assertions, which makes the test code more readable and easier to understand.

Overall, the `PermissionTxComparerTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project, as it ensures that the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class is working correctly and sorting transactions in the transaction pool in the expected order.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PermissionTxComparerTests` class?
- The `PermissionTxComparerTests` class is a test class that contains unit tests for the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class.

2. What is the purpose of the `OrderingTests` property?
- The `OrderingTests` property is a collection of test cases that test the ordering of transactions based on different criteria, such as sender whitelist, priority, and gas limit.

3. What is the purpose of the `SetPriority` method?
- The `SetPriority` method sets the priority of a transaction based on its target address and function signature. It does this by updating the `priorities` dictionary with the new priority value.
