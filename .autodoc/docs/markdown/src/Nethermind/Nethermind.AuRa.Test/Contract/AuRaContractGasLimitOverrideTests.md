The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverrideTests` class is a test suite for the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class. The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class is responsible for calculating the gas limit for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that can be used by transactions in a block. The gas limit is calculated based on the gas limit of the previous block, and can be overridden by a smart contract.

The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverrideTests` class contains several tests that ensure that the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class is working correctly. The first test, `can_read_block_gas_limit_from_contract`, tests that the gas limit can be read from a smart contract. The test creates a `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain` instance, which is a subclass of `TestContractBlockchain`. The `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain` class overrides the `CreateBlockProcessor` method to create an instance of `AuRaBlockProcessor` with an instance of `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` as the gas limit calculator. The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` instance is created with a `BlockGasLimitContract` instance, which represents the smart contract that can override the gas limit. The test then gets the gas limit for the head block of the blockchain and asserts that it is equal to `CorrectHeadGasLimit`.

The second test, `caches_read_block_gas_limit`, tests that the gas limit is cached after it is read from the smart contract. The test is similar to the first test, but after getting the gas limit for the head block, it gets the gas limit from the cache and asserts that it is equal to `CorrectHeadGasLimit`.

The third test, `can_validate_gas_limit_correct`, tests that the `IsGasLimitValid` method of `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` returns `true` when the gas limit is correct. The test creates a `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain` instance and calls the `IsGasLimitValid` method with the correct gas limit. The test asserts that the method returns `true`.

The fourth test, `can_validate_gas_limit_incorrect`, tests that the `IsGasLimitValid` method of `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` returns `false` when the gas limit is incorrect. The test is similar to the third test, but it calls the `IsGasLimitValid` method with an incorrect gas limit. The test asserts that the method returns `false` and that the expected gas limit is equal to `CorrectHeadGasLimit`.

The fifth test, `skip_validate_gas_limit_before_enabled`, tests that the `IsGasLimitValid` method of `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` returns `true` when the gas limit is incorrect and the smart contract that can override the gas limit has not been enabled yet. The test creates a `TestGasLimitContractBlockchainLateBlockGasLimit` instance, which is a subclass of `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain`. The `TestGasLimitContractBlockchainLateBlockGasLimit` class overrides the `CreateBlockProcessor` method to delay the activation of the smart contract that can override the gas limit. The test calls the `IsGasLimitValid` method with an incorrect gas limit and asserts that it returns `true`.

Overall, the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverrideTests` class tests the functionality of the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class, which is responsible for calculating the gas limit for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The tests ensure that the gas limit can be read from a smart contract, that it is cached after it is read, and that the `IsGasLimitValid` method returns the correct value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class?
- The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class is used to override the gas limit calculation for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm, using gas limit values obtained from a smart contract.

2. What is the significance of the `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain` class?
- The `TestGasLimitContractBlockchain` class is a test blockchain used to test the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class. It creates a gas limit contract and sets up the gas limit calculator to use the contract's gas limit values.

3. What is the purpose of the `GasLimitOverrideCache` property?
- The `GasLimitOverrideCache` property is used to cache gas limit values obtained from the gas limit contract, so that they can be quickly retrieved for future blocks without having to query the contract again.
