The code is a test suite for the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class, which is a data store for contract data that combines data from a contract and a local data source. The test suite contains five tests that verify the behavior of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class under different scenarios.

The first test, `assumes_empty_data_when_null`, verifies that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class returns an empty collection when the local data source returns null. The test creates a local data source that returns null and builds a test case with this data source. Then, it creates a block header and calls the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class with this block header. Finally, it asserts that the method returns an empty collection.

The second test, `returns_data_from_local_on_init`, verifies that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class returns data from the local data source when it is initialized. The test creates a local data source that returns an array of addresses and builds a test case with this data source. Then, it creates a block header and calls the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class with this block header. Finally, it asserts that the method returns the same array of addresses.

The third test, `reloads_data_from_local_on_changed`, verifies that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class reloads data from the local data source when the local data source is changed. The test creates a local data source that returns an array of addresses and builds a test case with this data source. Then, it creates a block header and calls the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class with this block header. Next, it changes the local data source to return a different array of addresses and raises the `Changed` event of the local data source. Finally, it asserts that the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method returns the new array of addresses.

The fourth test, `doesnt_reload_data_from_local_when_changed_not_fired`, verifies that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class does not reload data from the local data source when the `Changed` event of the local data source is not raised. The test creates a local data source that returns an array of addresses and builds a test case with this data source. Then, it creates a block header and calls the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class with this block header. Next, it changes the local data source to return a different array of addresses. Finally, it asserts that the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method returns the original array of addresses.

The fifth test, `combines_contract_and_local_data_correctly`, verifies that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class combines data from a contract and a local data source correctly. The test creates a local data source that returns an array of addresses and builds a test case with this data source and a data contract that returns a different array of addresses. Then, it creates a block header and calls the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class with this block header. Finally, it asserts that the method returns the combined array of addresses. The test repeats this process with a different block header and a different array of addresses to verify that the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class can handle multiple blocks. Finally, it changes the local data source to return a new array of addresses and raises the `Changed` event of the local data source. Then, it asserts that the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method returns the new combined array of addresses.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalDataTests` class?
- The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalDataTests` class is a test class that tests the behavior of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class.

2. What is the purpose of the `BuildTestCase` method?
- The `BuildTestCase` method is used to create a new instance of the `TestCase` class with the specified parameters, including an `ILocalDataSource` object, an `IDataContract` object, an `IBlockTree` object, and an `IReceiptFinder` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `assumes_empty_data_when_null` test method?
- The `assumes_empty_data_when_null` test method tests whether the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class returns an empty collection when the `Data` property of the `ILocalDataSource` object is null.
