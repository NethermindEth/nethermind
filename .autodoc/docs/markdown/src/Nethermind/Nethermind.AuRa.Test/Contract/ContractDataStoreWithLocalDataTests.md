This code file contains a class called `ContractDataStoreWithLocalDataTests` which is a test class for the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class. The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is responsible for storing contract data in a local data source and retrieving it when required. The purpose of this test class is to test the functionality of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class.

The test class contains five test methods. The first test method `assumes_empty_data_when_null` tests the scenario where the local data source returns null. In this case, the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class should return an empty list. The second test method `returns_data_from_local_on_init` tests the scenario where the local data source returns some data. In this case, the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class should return the data returned by the local data source. The third test method `reloads_data_from_local_on_changed` tests the scenario where the local data source data is changed. In this case, the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class should return the updated data. The fourth test method `doesnt_reload_data_from_local_when_changed_not_fired` tests the scenario where the local data source data is not changed. In this case, the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class should return the original data. The fifth test method `combines_contract_and_local_data_correctly` tests the scenario where the local data source data is combined with the contract data. In this case, the `GetItemsFromContractAtBlock` method of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class should return the combined data.

The `BuildTestCase` method is a helper method that creates a test case object. The test case object contains a `DataContract` object, a `BlockTree` object, a `ReceiptFinder` object, and a `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` object. The `DataContract` object is a mock object that is used to simulate the contract data. The `BlockTree` object is a mock object that is used to simulate the blockchain. The `ReceiptFinder` object is a mock object that is used to simulate the transaction receipts. The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` object is the object being tested.

In summary, this code file contains a test class for the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class. The test class tests the functionality of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class in various scenarios. The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is responsible for storing contract data in a local data source and retrieving it when required.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains tests for the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class in the `Nethermind` project.

2. What other classes or libraries does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several classes and libraries, including `System`, `FluentAssertions`, `Nethermind.Blockchain`, `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Contracts`, and `NSubstitute`.

3. What is the expected behavior being tested in these tests?
