The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverrideTests` class is a test suite for the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class, which is responsible for calculating the gas limit for new blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that can be used in a block, and it is an important parameter for the Ethereum network because it affects the cost of executing transactions and smart contracts.

The `GetGasLimit` method is a test case that checks if the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class correctly calculates the gas limit for different block numbers and configurations. The test case uses the `NSubstitute` library to create mock objects of the `IBlockGasLimitContract` interface, which is used to retrieve the gas limit from different contracts. The `BlocksConfig` object is used to set the target block gas limit, which is the maximum gas limit that can be set by the network.

The test case checks if the `GetGasLimit` method returns the expected gas limit for different block numbers and configurations. For example, when `minimum2MlnGasPerBlockWhenUsingBlockGasLimit` is `false` and `blockNumber` is `1`, the expected gas limit is `4000000`. When `minimum2MlnGasPerBlockWhenUsingBlockGasLimit` is `true` and `blockNumber` is `3`, the expected gas limit is `2000000`. When `blockNumber` is `10`, the `BlockGasLimit` method of `blockGasLimitContract3` throws an exception, which should be caught by the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class and return `null`.

This test case is important for ensuring that the gas limit calculation is correct and consistent across different configurations and block numbers. It also helps to identify any bugs or issues in the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class that could affect the stability and security of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class?
- The `AuRaContractGasLimitOverride` class is used to calculate the gas limit for a block based on various factors, including the block number and the gas limit contracts that are active at that time.

2. What is the significance of the `TestCase` attributes on the `GetGasLimit` method?
- The `TestCase` attributes are used to define different test cases for the `GetGasLimit` method, with different input parameters and expected output values. This allows for comprehensive testing of the method's functionality.

3. What is the purpose of the `IBlockGasLimitContract` interface, and how is it used in this code?
- The `IBlockGasLimitContract` interface defines a contract for calculating the gas limit for a block. In this code, multiple instances of classes that implement this interface are created and used to calculate the gas limit for a given block, based on the block's header.
