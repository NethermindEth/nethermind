The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class is a part of the Nethermind project and implements the `IReleaseSpec` interface. It provides a way to access the release specifications for the System transaction. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to check whether certain Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are enabled or disabled for the System transaction.

The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class takes an instance of `IReleaseSpec` as a constructor parameter and delegates all of its properties to the provided instance. This allows the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` to inherit all of the properties of the provided `IReleaseSpec` instance and override only the properties that are specific to the System transaction.

The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class provides properties for all of the EIPs that are relevant to the System transaction. These properties are boolean values that indicate whether the EIP is enabled or disabled for the System transaction. For example, the `IsEip1559Enabled` property indicates whether EIP-1559 is enabled for the System transaction.

The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class also provides properties for other release specifications such as the maximum extra data size, maximum code size, minimum gas limit, block reward, and difficulty bomb delay. These properties are inherited from the provided `IReleaseSpec` instance.

Overall, the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class provides a convenient way to access the release specifications for the System transaction and check whether certain EIPs are enabled or disabled for the System transaction. This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to implement functionality that is specific to the System transaction and depends on the state of certain EIPs. For example, a module that processes System transactions could use the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class to determine whether EIP-1559 is enabled and adjust its behavior accordingly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class?
- The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class is a release specification that implements the `IReleaseSpec` interface and provides information about the system transaction release.

2. What is the `_spec` field and how is it used?
- The `_spec` field is an instance of the `IReleaseSpec` interface that is passed to the constructor of the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class. It is used to delegate the implementation of the interface's properties and methods to the wrapped release specification.

3. What is the significance of the various `IsEipXEnabled` properties?
- The `IsEipXEnabled` properties indicate whether a particular Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is enabled in the release specification. For example, `IsEip1559Enabled` indicates whether EIP-1559 is enabled.
