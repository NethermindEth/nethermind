The code above defines a class called `BuiltInJson` that is used in the Nethermind project to represent built-in JSON objects. The class has two properties: `Name` and `Pricing`. 

The `Name` property is a string that represents the name of the built-in JSON object. The `Pricing` property is a dictionary that maps string keys to `JObject` values. `JObject` is a class from the Newtonsoft.Json library that represents a JSON object. 

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to represent built-in JSON objects that are used in the chain specification. The chain specification is a set of rules that define how the blockchain operates. It includes things like block validation rules, transaction validation rules, and consensus rules. 

By representing built-in JSON objects in this way, the Nethermind project can easily parse and manipulate these objects in code. For example, if the chain specification includes a rule that specifies a certain block reward for miners, this information could be represented as a `BuiltInJson` object with a `Name` property of "blockReward" and a `Pricing` property that maps the currency symbol to the reward amount. 

Overall, this code is a small but important piece of the Nethermind project's infrastructure for defining and enforcing the chain specification.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file is defining a class called `BuiltInJson` with two properties: `Name` and `Pricing`, which is a dictionary of string keys and `JObject` values.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX` comments at the top of the file?
   - The `SPDX` comments indicate the copyright holder and license information for the code. In this case, the code is owned by Demerzel Solutions Limited and licensed under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the namespace `Nethermind.Specs.ChainSpecStyle.Json` used for?
   - The namespace `Nethermind.Specs.ChainSpecStyle.Json` is used to organize classes related to JSON serialization and deserialization in the Nethermind project. This particular class, `BuiltInJson`, is likely used to represent some built-in data in the project that is stored in JSON format.
