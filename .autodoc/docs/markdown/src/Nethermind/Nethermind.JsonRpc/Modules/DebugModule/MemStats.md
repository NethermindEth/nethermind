The code above defines a C# class called `MemStats` within the `DebugModule` namespace of the Nethermind project. This class has a single public property called `TotalMemory` of type `long`. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to retrieve information about the memory usage of the Nethermind application during runtime. This information can be useful for debugging and performance optimization purposes. 

For example, if a developer suspects that the Nethermind application is using too much memory, they can use this class to retrieve the current total memory usage and compare it to previous measurements to see if there is a trend of increasing memory usage. 

To use this class, a developer would first need to instantiate an object of the `MemStats` class. They can then access the `TotalMemory` property to retrieve the current total memory usage. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.DebugModule;

// ...

MemStats memStats = new MemStats();
long currentMemoryUsage = memStats.TotalMemory;
Console.WriteLine($"Current memory usage: {currentMemoryUsage} bytes");
```

In this example, the `MemStats` class is used to retrieve the current memory usage of the Nethermind application and print it to the console.
