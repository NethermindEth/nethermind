The `DebugRpcModule` class is a module that provides debugging functionality for the Nethermind project. It contains methods that allow users to trace transactions, blocks, and get information about the blockchain. 

The class implements the `IDebugRpcModule` interface, which defines the methods that can be called by external clients. The constructor takes in an `ILogManager`, an `IDebugBridge`, and an `IJsonRpcConfig` object. The `IDebugBridge` is an interface that provides access to the debugging functionality of the Nethermind project. The `IJsonRpcConfig` object contains configuration information for the JSON-RPC server.

The `DebugRpcModule` class contains several methods that allow users to trace transactions and blocks. The `debug_traceTransaction` method takes in a transaction hash and returns a `GethLikeTxTrace` object that contains information about the transaction execution. The `debug_traceBlock` method takes in a block RLP and returns an array of `GethLikeTxTrace` objects that contain information about the execution of all transactions in the block.

The `DebugRpcModule` class also contains methods that allow users to get information about the blockchain. The `debug_getChainLevel` method takes in a block number and returns a `ChainLevelForRpc` object that contains information about the chain level. The `debug_getBlockRlp` method takes in a block number and returns the RLP-encoded block.

Overall, the `DebugRpcModule` class provides debugging functionality for the Nethermind project. It allows users to trace transactions and blocks, and get information about the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DebugRpcModule` class?
- The `DebugRpcModule` class is a module for the Nethermind JSON-RPC API that provides debugging functionality.

2. What is the role of the `IDebugBridge` interface?
- The `IDebugBridge` interface is used by the `DebugRpcModule` class to interact with the Nethermind debug subsystem.

3. What is the purpose of the `debug_traceTransaction` method?
- The `debug_traceTransaction` method is used to retrieve a Geth-style transaction trace for a given transaction hash, with optional trace options.
