The code above defines a C# class called `PortsInfo` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's JSON-RPC module for administrative tasks. The purpose of this class is to provide information about the ports used by the `Nethermind` node for discovery and listening.

The class has two properties, `Discovery` and `Listener`, both of which are integers. These properties are decorated with the `JsonProperty` attribute from the `Newtonsoft.Json` namespace, which is used to specify the names of the properties when they are serialized to JSON. The `Order` property of the attribute is used to specify the order in which the properties should appear in the JSON output.

This class can be used in the larger `Nethermind` project to provide information about the ports used by the node for discovery and listening. For example, it could be used by an administrative tool to display this information to the user or to configure the ports used by the node.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the `Nethermind` project:

```csharp
PortsInfo portsInfo = new PortsInfo();
portsInfo.Discovery = 30303;
portsInfo.Listener = 30304;

string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(portsInfo);
Console.WriteLine(json);
```

In this example, a new `PortsInfo` object is created and its `Discovery` and `Listener` properties are set to `30303` and `30304`, respectively. The `JsonConvert.SerializeObject` method from the `Newtonsoft.Json` namespace is then used to serialize the object to a JSON string, which is printed to the console. The output of this code would be:

```json
{"discovery":30303,"listener":30304}
```

This output shows that the `PortsInfo` object was successfully serialized to JSON with the property names specified by the `JsonProperty` attributes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a C# class called `PortsInfo` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's JSON-RPC module for administrative tasks. It has two properties, `Discovery` and `Listener`, which are integers representing port numbers.

2. What is the significance of the `JsonProperty` attribute?
   The `JsonProperty` attribute is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to each C# property in the `PortsInfo` class. The `Order` parameter is used to specify the order in which the properties should appear in the JSON output.

3. What is the license for this code?
   The code is licensed under the LGPL-3.0-only license, as indicated by the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code, as long as any changes are also made available under the same license.
