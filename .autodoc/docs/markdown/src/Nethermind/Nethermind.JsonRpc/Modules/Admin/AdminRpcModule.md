The `AdminRpcModule` class is a module that provides a set of administrative JSON-RPC methods for managing a node in the Nethermind project. The module is responsible for managing peers, providing node information, and triggering pruning of the blockchain.

The class constructor takes in several dependencies, including `IBlockTree`, `INetworkConfig`, `IPeerPool`, `IStaticNodesManager`, `IEnode`, `string`, and `ManualPruningTrigger`. These dependencies are used to build the `NodeInfo` object that contains information about the node, including its name, enode, IP address, and port. The `UpdateEthProtocolInfo` method is called to update the `NodeInfo` object with information about the Ethereum protocol, including the current difficulty, chain ID, head hash, and genesis hash.

The `admin_addPeer` method is used to add a new peer to the node. The method takes in an `enode` string and a boolean `addToStaticNodes` flag. If `addToStaticNodes` is true, the `enode` is added to the static nodes list. Otherwise, a new `NetworkNode` object is created from the `enode` string, and a new `Node` object is added to the `IPeerPool`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper<string>` object that contains the `enode` string if the peer was added successfully, or an error message if the peer could not be added.

The `admin_removePeer` method is used to remove a peer from the node. The method takes in an `enode` string and a boolean `removeFromStaticNodes` flag. If `removeFromStaticNodes` is true, the `enode` is removed from the static nodes list. Otherwise, the peer is removed from the `IPeerPool`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper<string>` object that contains the `enode` string if the peer was removed successfully, or an error message if the peer could not be removed.

The `admin_peers` method returns an array of `PeerInfo` objects that contain information about the active peers connected to the node. The `includeDetails` flag can be set to true to include additional details about each peer.

The `admin_nodeInfo` method returns the `NodeInfo` object that contains information about the node, including its name, enode, IP address, and port, as well as information about the Ethereum protocol.

The `admin_dataDir` method returns the data directory path for the node.

The `admin_setSolc` method is a placeholder method that always returns true.

The `admin_prune` method triggers pruning of the blockchain. The method returns a `ResultWrapper<PruningStatus>` object that contains information about the pruning status. The `ManualPruningTrigger` dependency is used to trigger the pruning process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AdminRpcModule` class?
- The `AdminRpcModule` class is a JSON-RPC module that provides administrative functionality for the Nethermind node.

2. What dependencies does the `AdminRpcModule` class have?
- The `AdminRpcModule` class depends on several interfaces and classes from the `Nethermind` namespace, including `IBlockTree`, `INetworkConfig`, `IPeerPool`, `IStaticNodesManager`, and `IEnode`.

3. What functionality does the `admin_addPeer` method provide?
- The `admin_addPeer` method adds a new peer to the node's peer pool, either as a regular peer or as a static node. It returns a `ResultWrapper<string>` object indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
