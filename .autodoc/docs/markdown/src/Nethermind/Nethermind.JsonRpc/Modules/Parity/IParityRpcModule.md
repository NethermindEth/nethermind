The code defines an interface called `IParityRpcModule` that extends another interface called `IRpcModule`. This interface contains several methods that can be used to interact with the Parity Ethereum client. 

The first method, `parity_pendingTransactions`, returns a list of transactions currently in the queue. If an address is provided, it returns transactions only with the given sender address. The method takes an optional `address` parameter of type `Address`, which defaults to `null`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains an array of `ParityTransaction` objects. An example response is provided in the code comments.

The second method, `parity_getBlockReceipts`, returns receipts from all transactions from a particular block. It is more efficient than fetching the receipts one-by-one. The method takes a `blockParameter` parameter of type `BlockParameter`, which can be set to a block number, block hash, or "latest". The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains an array of `ReceiptForRpc` objects. An example response is provided in the code comments.

The third method, `parity_enode`, returns the node enode URI. It takes no parameters and returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains a string representing the enode URI. An example response is provided in the code comments.

The fourth method, `parity_setEngineSigner`, sets the engine signer for the Parity client. It takes an `address` parameter of type `Address` and a `password` parameter of type `string`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. An example parameter value is provided in the code comments.

The fifth method, `parity_setEngineSignerSecret`, sets the engine signer secret for the Parity client. It takes a `privateKey` parameter of type `string`. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

The sixth method, `parity_clearEngineSigner`, clears the engine signer for the Parity client. It takes no parameters and returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

The seventh method, `parity_netPeers`, returns connected peers. Peers with non-empty protocols have completed handshake. It takes no parameters and returns a `ResultWrapper` object that contains a `ParityNetPeers` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IParityRpcModule` interface?
- The `IParityRpcModule` interface defines a set of methods that can be used to interact with the Parity Ethereum client via JSON-RPC.

2. What is the `parity_pendingTransactions` method used for?
- The `parity_pendingTransactions` method returns a list of transactions currently in the queue, and can optionally filter by sender address.

3. What is the `parity_setEngineSigner` method used for?
- The `parity_setEngineSigner` method sets the engine signer for the Parity client, which is used to sign transactions and blocks. It takes an address and password as parameters.
