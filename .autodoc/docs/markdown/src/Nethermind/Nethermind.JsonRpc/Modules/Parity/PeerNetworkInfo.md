This code defines a C# class called `PeerNetworkInfo` that is used in the Nethermind project's JSON-RPC module for Parity. The purpose of this class is to represent information about a peer's network connection, including the local and remote IP addresses.

The class has two properties, `LocalAddress` and `RemoteAddress`, both of which are strings. These properties are decorated with the `JsonProperty` attribute from the Newtonsoft.Json library, which specifies the names of the properties as they should appear in JSON serialization. The `Order` property of the attribute is also set to ensure that the properties are serialized in the correct order.

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the network connections between nodes in the Ethereum network. It may be used in conjunction with other classes and modules to facilitate communication and data exchange between nodes.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in code:

```
PeerNetworkInfo peerInfo = new PeerNetworkInfo();
peerInfo.LocalAddress = "192.168.1.100";
peerInfo.RemoteAddress = "203.0.113.1";

string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(peerInfo);
```

In this example, a new `PeerNetworkInfo` object is created and its `LocalAddress` and `RemoteAddress` properties are set. The object is then serialized to a JSON string using the `JsonConvert.SerializeObject` method from the Newtonsoft.Json library. The resulting JSON string would look something like this:

```
{
  "localAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "remoteAddress": "203.0.113.1"
}
```

Overall, this code provides a simple but important piece of functionality for the Nethermind project's JSON-RPC module, allowing for the representation and exchange of network connection information between nodes in the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `PeerNetworkInfo` in the `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Parity` namespace, which has two properties for local and remote addresses of a peer network.

2. What is the significance of the `JsonProperty` attribute used in this code?
- The `JsonProperty` attribute is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to the C# property, as well as its order in the JSON object.

3. What is the license for this code file?
- The license for this code file is specified in the SPDX-License-Identifier comment as LGPL-3.0-only, which means it is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0 or later.
