The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is responsible for building a collection of JSON-RPC URLs that the Nethermind client can use to communicate with other nodes on the network. The class extends the `Dictionary<int, JsonRpcUrl>` class and implements the `IJsonRpcUrlCollection` interface. 

The constructor takes in an `ILogManager` instance, an `IJsonRpcConfig` instance, and a boolean flag `includeWebSockets`. The `ILogManager` instance is used to get a logger instance, while the `IJsonRpcConfig` instance contains configuration information for the JSON-RPC server. The `includeWebSockets` flag is used to determine whether to include WebSocket URLs in the collection.

The `BuildUrls` method is called from the constructor if JSON-RPC is enabled in the configuration. It creates a default JSON-RPC URL using the configuration information and adds it to the collection. If the `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable is set, it attempts to parse it as a URI and uses it to override the default URL. If `includeWebSockets` is true, it creates a WebSocket URL and adds it to the collection.

The `BuildEngineUrls` method is called from `BuildUrls` if the `EnginePort` configuration property is set. It creates a JSON-RPC URL for the execution engine and adds it to the collection. If `includeWebSockets` is true, it adds the WebSocket endpoint to the URL.

The `BuildAdditionalUrls` method is called from `BuildUrls` and adds any additional JSON-RPC URLs specified in the configuration to the collection. It parses each URL and checks if it has a WebSocket endpoint and whether the engine module is enabled. If the URL is valid and not already in the collection, it is added.

The `Urls` property returns an array of strings representing the URLs in the collection.

Overall, this class is an important part of the Nethermind client's JSON-RPC functionality, as it provides a way to manage and use multiple URLs for communication with other nodes on the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class?
- The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is a dictionary that stores JSON-RPC URLs and their associated ports, and provides methods for building and retrieving these URLs.

2. What is the significance of the `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable?
- The `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable is used to override the default JSON-RPC URL specified in the `IJsonRpcConfig` object, allowing developers to specify a custom URL for their application.

3. What is the purpose of the `BuildAdditionalUrls` method?
- The `BuildAdditionalUrls` method iterates over a list of additional JSON-RPC URLs specified in the `IJsonRpcConfig` object, parses each URL, and adds it to the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` if it is not already present and does not conflict with any existing URLs.
