The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used to represent a URL for a JSON-RPC endpoint. It contains information about the scheme, host, port, and enabled modules for the endpoint. The class provides methods for parsing a packed URL value, checking if a module is enabled, and checking if two `JsonRpcUrl` objects are equal.

The `JsonRpcUrl` constructor takes in a scheme, host, port, `RpcEndpoint`, a boolean indicating whether the endpoint is authenticated, and an array of enabled modules. The `RpcEndpoint` is an enum that represents the type of endpoint (HTTP or WebSocket). The `enabledModules` array is a list of modules that are enabled for the endpoint.

The `Parse` method is used to parse a packed URL value into a `JsonRpcUrl` object. The packed URL value is a string that contains the URL, endpoint values, and enabled modules, separated by '|'. The `Parse` method checks that the packed URL value is in the correct format and throws a `FormatException` if it is not. It then creates a new `JsonRpcUrl` object with the parsed values.

The `IsModuleEnabled` method is used to check if a module is enabled for the endpoint. It takes in a module name and returns a boolean indicating whether the module is enabled.

The `Equals` method is used to check if two `JsonRpcUrl` objects are equal. It checks that the scheme, host, port, `RpcEndpoint`, authentication status, and enabled modules are equal. The `GetHashCode` method is used to generate a hash code for the `JsonRpcUrl` object.

Overall, the `JsonRpcUrl` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it is used to represent JSON-RPC endpoints. It provides methods for parsing packed URL values, checking if a module is enabled, and checking if two `JsonRpcUrl` objects are equal.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrl` class?
    
    The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used to represent a URL for a JSON-RPC endpoint, including the scheme, host, port, enabled modules, and authentication status.

2. What is the `Parse` method used for?
    
    The `Parse` method is used to create a new `JsonRpcUrl` instance from a packed URL string, which contains the URL, endpoint values, and enabled modules, separated by '|' characters.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsModuleEnabled` method?
    
    The `IsModuleEnabled` method is used to determine if a specific module is enabled for the JSON-RPC endpoint represented by the `JsonRpcUrl` instance. It returns `true` if the module is enabled, and `false` otherwise.
