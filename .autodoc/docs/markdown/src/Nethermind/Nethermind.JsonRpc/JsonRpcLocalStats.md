The `JsonRpcLocalStats` class is responsible for collecting and reporting statistics related to JSON-RPC calls made by the Nethermind client. It implements the `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface and provides methods for reporting and retrieving statistics for individual JSON-RPC methods.

The class maintains three dictionaries to store statistics for each JSON-RPC method: `_currentStats`, `_previousStats`, and `_allTimeStats`. `_currentStats` stores the statistics for the current reporting interval, `_previousStats` stores the statistics for the previous reporting interval, and `_allTimeStats` stores the statistics for all JSON-RPC calls made since the client was started.

The `ReportCall` method is used to report a JSON-RPC call and update the corresponding statistics. It takes an `RpcReport` object that contains information about the call, such as the method name, handling time, and success status. If the method name is empty or null, the call is ignored. If the time since the last report exceeds the reporting interval, the `BuildReport` method is called to generate a report and log it using the client's logger.

The `GetMethodStats` method is used to retrieve the statistics for a specific JSON-RPC method. It takes the method name as a parameter and returns a `MethodStats` object that contains the average handling time, maximum handling time, number of successes, number of errors, average size of the response, and total size of the responses for the method.

The `BuildReport` method generates a report of the statistics for all JSON-RPC methods and logs it using the client's logger. The report includes the method name, number of successes, average handling time for successes, maximum handling time for successes, number of errors, average handling time for errors, maximum handling time for errors, average response size, and total response size for each method. It also includes a total row that summarizes the statistics for all methods.

Overall, the `JsonRpcLocalStats` class provides a way to monitor the performance and usage of the JSON-RPC interface in the Nethermind client. It can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, track usage patterns, and optimize the client's behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `JsonRpcLocalStats` that implements the `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface. It provides methods for reporting and retrieving statistics related to JSON-RPC calls.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other classes and interfaces defined in the `Nethermind.Core` and `Nethermind.Logging` namespaces. It also uses the `System` namespace and the `ConcurrentDictionary` and `StringBuilder` classes from the `System.Collections.Concurrent` and `System.Text` namespaces, respectively.

3. What is the significance of the `reportingInterval` field?
- The `reportingInterval` field is a `TimeSpan` that determines how often statistics should be reported. If the time elapsed since the last report exceeds this interval, a new report is generated and logged.
