The `ByteBufferExtensions` class provides a set of extension methods for the `IByteBuffer` interface. These methods are used to read and write bytes from and to a buffer, and to convert the buffer to different data types. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to work with byte buffers in the context of the Nethermind project.

The `ReadAllBytesAsArray` method reads all the bytes from the buffer and returns them as an array. The `ReadAllBytesAsSpan` and `ReadAllBytesAsMemory` methods do the same, but return the bytes as a span and a memory, respectively. These methods are useful when working with byte arrays, spans, and memories, which are commonly used in the Nethermind project.

The `ReadAllHex` method reads all the bytes from the buffer and returns them as a hexadecimal string. This method is useful when working with hexadecimal strings, which are commonly used in the Nethermind project.

The `WriteBytes` method writes the specified bytes to the buffer. This method is useful when writing data to a buffer.

The `MarkIndex` and `ResetIndex` methods mark and reset the reader and writer indexes of the buffer, respectively. These methods are useful when working with byte buffers that need to be read and written to multiple times.

The `AsSpan` method returns a span that represents the readable space of the buffer. This method is useful when working with spans, which are commonly used in the Nethermind project.

Overall, the `ByteBufferExtensions` class provides a set of convenient methods for working with byte buffers in the context of the Nethermind project. These methods are used to read and write bytes, convert buffers to different data types, and manipulate the indexes of the buffer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains extension methods for the `IByteBuffer` interface related to reading and writing bytes and spans.

2. What is the `IByteBuffer` interface and where is it defined?
    
    The `IByteBuffer` interface is not defined in this code file, but is likely defined in another file within the `Nethermind` project. It is used to represent a buffer of bytes that can be read from and written to.

3. What is the purpose of the `MarkIndex` and `ResetIndex` methods?
    
    The `MarkIndex` method sets the reader and writer indices of the buffer to their current positions, while the `ResetIndex` method resets the reader and writer indices to their previously marked positions. These methods can be used to temporarily move the indices while reading or writing data, and then return to the original positions.
