The `SocketClient` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to handle socket communication between clients. The class implements the `ISocketsClient` interface and provides methods to send and receive messages. 

The `SocketClient` constructor takes three parameters: `clientName`, `handler`, and `jsonSerializer`. The `clientName` parameter is a string that represents the name of the client. The `handler` parameter is an instance of the `ISocketHandler` interface, which is used to handle socket communication. The `jsonSerializer` parameter is an instance of the `IJsonSerializer` interface, which is used to serialize and deserialize JSON data.

The `SocketClient` class has three properties: `Id`, `ClientName`, and `_handler`. The `Id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the client. The `ClientName` property is a string that represents the name of the client. The `_handler` property is an instance of the `ISocketHandler` interface, which is used to handle socket communication.

The `SocketClient` class has three methods: `ProcessAsync`, `SendAsync`, and `ReceiveAsync`. The `ProcessAsync` method takes an `ArraySegment<byte>` parameter and is used to process received data. The `SendAsync` method takes a `SocketsMessage` parameter and is used to send data to the client. The `ReceiveAsync` method is used to receive data from the client.

The `SendAsync` method first checks if the `SocketsMessage` parameter is null. If it is null, the method returns `Task.CompletedTask`. If the `SocketsMessage` parameter is not null, the method serializes the message to JSON and sends it to the client using the `_handler` instance.

The `ReceiveAsync` method is used to receive data from the client. The method first creates a buffer using the `ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Rent` method. The method then calls the `_handler.GetReceiveResult` method to receive data from the client. The method then processes the received data and checks if the message is too long. If the message is too long, the method throws an `InvalidOperationException`. If the message is not too long, the method continues to receive data from the client until the connection is closed. Finally, the method returns the buffer to the pool using the `ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Return` method.

In summary, the `SocketClient` class is used to handle socket communication between clients. The class provides methods to send and receive messages and uses the `ISocketHandler` interface to handle socket communication. The class also uses the `IJsonSerializer` interface to serialize and deserialize JSON data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SocketClient` class?
- The `SocketClient` class is a C# implementation of a socket client that implements the `ISocketsClient` interface.

2. What is the purpose of the `MAX_POOLED_SIZE` constant?
- The `MAX_POOLED_SIZE` constant is used to set the maximum size of the buffer that is used to receive data from the socket. If the buffer grows larger than this size, an exception is thrown.

3. What is the purpose of the `SendAsync` method?
- The `SendAsync` method is used to send a `SocketsMessage` object to the socket. The message is serialized to JSON and sent to the socket using the `_handler` object.
