[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Wallet/WalletConfig.cs)

The code above defines a class called `WalletConfig` that implements the `IWalletConfig` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide configuration options for the Nethermind wallet module. 

The `WalletConfig` class has a single property called `DevAccounts` which is an integer that represents the number of developer accounts that should be created when the wallet is initialized. By default, this value is set to 10. 

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way for developers to configure the wallet module to their specific needs. For example, if a developer is working on a project that requires a large number of test accounts, they can set the `DevAccounts` property to a higher value. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Nethermind project:

```csharp
var walletConfig = new WalletConfig();
walletConfig.DevAccounts = 20;

var wallet = new Wallet(walletConfig);
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `WalletConfig` class and set the `DevAccounts` property to 20. We then pass this configuration object to the `Wallet` constructor, which uses it to initialize the wallet with the specified number of developer accounts. 

Overall, the `WalletConfig` class provides a simple and flexible way for developers to configure the Nethermind wallet module to their specific needs.
