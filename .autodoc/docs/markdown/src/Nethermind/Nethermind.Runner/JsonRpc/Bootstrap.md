The `Bootstrap` class is responsible for registering JSON-RPC related services in the dependency injection container. It is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to bootstrap the JSON-RPC server.

The class has a private constructor and a private static instance of itself. The instance is created lazily using the null-coalescing operator. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the lifetime of the application.

The class has five properties, all of which are nullable interfaces. These properties are used to inject dependencies into the class. The `JsonRpcService` property is used to inject the JSON-RPC service, the `LogManager` property is used to inject the logging service, the `JsonSerializer` property is used to inject the JSON serializer, the `JsonRpcLocalStats` property is used to inject the local statistics service, and the `JsonRpcAuthentication` property is used to inject the authentication service.

The `RegisterJsonRpcServices` method takes an instance of `IServiceCollection` as a parameter and registers the JSON-RPC related services in the container. It uses the `AddSingleton` method to register the services as singletons. This ensures that only one instance of each service is created throughout the lifetime of the application.

Here is an example of how the `Bootstrap` class can be used to register JSON-RPC related services in the dependency injection container:

```
var services = new ServiceCollection();
Bootstrap.Instance.JsonRpcService = new JsonRpcService();
Bootstrap.Instance.LogManager = new LogManager();
Bootstrap.Instance.JsonSerializer = new JsonSerializer();
Bootstrap.Instance.JsonRpcLocalStats = new JsonRpcLocalStats();
Bootstrap.Instance.JsonRpcAuthentication = new RpcAuthentication();
Bootstrap.Instance.RegisterJsonRpcServices(services);
```

This code creates a new instance of `ServiceCollection`, sets the properties of the `Bootstrap` instance, and registers the JSON-RPC related services in the container using the `RegisterJsonRpcServices` method. The registered services can then be used throughout the application by injecting them into other classes using the dependency injection container.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a class called `Bootstrap` that registers JSON-RPC related services in the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection container.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
   - This code file depends on `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, `Nethermind.Core.Authentication`, `Nethermind.JsonRpc`, `Nethermind.Logging`, and `Nethermind.Serialization.Json`.

3. What is the significance of the `Instance` property?
   - The `Instance` property is a singleton instance of the `Bootstrap` class, which ensures that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application.
