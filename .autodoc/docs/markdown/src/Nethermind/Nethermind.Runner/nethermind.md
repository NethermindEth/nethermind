This code defines CSS variables for the Nethermind project's user interface. These variables are used to set the colors and images used throughout the project's UI. 

The `:root` selector is used to define the variables globally, so they can be accessed and used by any element in the project. 

The `--primaryColor` variable is set to a light gray color, which is used as the primary color for the UI. The `--secondaryColor` variable is set to a bright orange color, which is used as a secondary color for buttons and other UI elements. 

The `--bgMenuActive` variable is set to a bright blue color, which is used as the background color for active menu items. The `--bgButton` variable is set to the same bright orange color as `--secondaryColor`, which is used as the background color for buttons. 

The `--logoImageUrl` variable is set to the URL of the Nethermind project's logo image, which is used as the logo throughout the UI. 

Finally, the `--bgAside` variable is set to the same light gray color as `--primaryColor`, which is used as the background color for sidebars and other UI elements. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the Nethermind project's UI design, as it sets the colors and images used throughout the project's UI. Here is an example of how these variables might be used in a CSS file:

```
.header {
  background-color: var(--primaryColor);
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--bgButton);
  color: white;
}

.logo {
  background-image: var(--logoImageUrl);
}

.active-menu-item {
  background-color: var(--bgMenuActive);
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: var(--bgAside);
}
```
