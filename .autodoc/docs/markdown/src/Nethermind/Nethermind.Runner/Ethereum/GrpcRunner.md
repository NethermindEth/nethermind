The `GrpcRunner` class is responsible for starting and stopping a gRPC server for the Nethermind project. The class takes in a `NethermindService.NethermindServiceBase` object, an `IGrpcConfig` object, and an `ILogManager` object as parameters in its constructor. The `NethermindService.NethermindServiceBase` object is the implementation of the gRPC service that will be hosted by the server. The `IGrpcConfig` object contains the configuration information for the server, such as the host and port to bind to. The `ILogManager` object is used to obtain a logger instance for the class.

The `Start` method starts the gRPC server by creating a new `Server` object and setting its services and ports to the implementation and configuration objects passed in through the constructor. The server is then started and the logger is used to output an informational message indicating that the server has started. The method returns a `Task` object that is completed when the server has started.

The `StopAsync` method stops the gRPC server by shutting down the server and all of its channels. The logger is used to output an informational message indicating that the server is being stopped. The method returns a `Task` object that is completed when the server has been stopped.

Overall, the `GrpcRunner` class provides a simple way to start and stop a gRPC server for the Nethermind project. It can be used in conjunction with other classes and services to provide a complete solution for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. An example of how this class might be used is shown below:

```
var service = new MyNethermindService();
var config = new MyGrpcConfig();
var logManager = new MyLogManager();
var runner = new GrpcRunner(service, config, logManager);

await runner.Start(CancellationToken.None);

// Do some work with the gRPC server...

await runner.StopAsync();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a `GrpcRunner` class that starts and stops a GRPC server using the `NethermindService` service and configuration provided.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on `System.Threading`, `Grpc.Core`, `Nethermind.Grpc`, and `Nethermind.Logging`.

3. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released, in this case the LGPL-3.0-only license.
