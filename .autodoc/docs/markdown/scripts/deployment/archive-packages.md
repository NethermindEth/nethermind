This code is a Bash script that is used to archive Nethermind packages. The purpose of this script is to create compressed archives of the Nethermind packages for different platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. These archives can then be distributed to users who want to install and run Nethermind on their machines.

The script starts by setting the "set -e" option, which causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails. This ensures that the script stops running if there are any errors, preventing any further issues from occurring.

The script then creates a directory for the packages using the "mkdir" command and changes to the directory using the "cd" command. It then changes to the "PUB_DIR" directory, which contains the packages for different platforms.

The script then uses the "cd" command to change to each platform's directory and creates a compressed archive of the package using the "zip" command. The archives are named according to the platform and package prefix, which are defined elsewhere in the project.

Once all the archives have been created, the script prints a message indicating that the archiving process has been completed.

This script is likely used as part of a larger build or release process for the Nethermind project. It allows developers to easily create compressed archives of the Nethermind packages for different platforms, which can then be distributed to users. By automating this process, the script saves time and reduces the risk of errors that could occur if the archives were created manually.
