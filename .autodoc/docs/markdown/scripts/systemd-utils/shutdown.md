This code is a shell script that is used to stop the Nethermind service. Nethermind is a project that provides a client implementation of the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this script is to gracefully shut down the Nethermind service by stopping the systemd service that is running it.

The script starts by defining two variables, `On_Green` and `Color_Off`, which are used to set the color of the output text. The `On_Green` variable sets the background color of the text to green, while the `Color_Off` variable resets the color to the default.

The `echo` command is then used to print a message to the console indicating that the Nethermind service is being shut down. The message is printed in green text on a black background.

The `stopNethermind` function is defined next. This function uses the `systemctl` command to stop the Nethermind service. The `sudo` command is used to run the `systemctl` command with root privileges.

After the `stopNethermind` function is defined, it is called to stop the Nethermind service.

Finally, another `echo` command is used to print a message to the console indicating that the Nethermind service has been successfully stopped. The message is printed in green text on a black background.

This script can be used as part of a larger project that requires the Nethermind service to be stopped gracefully. For example, if a user wants to update the Nethermind client, they may need to stop the service first to avoid any conflicts or errors during the update process. The script can be called as part of an update script to ensure that the Nethermind service is stopped before the update is applied. 

Example usage:

```
$ ./stop_nethermind.sh
 Shutting down nethermind.service...
 OK
```
