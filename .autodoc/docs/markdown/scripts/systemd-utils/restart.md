This code is a shell script that restarts the `nethermind.service` on a Linux system. The `nethermind.service` is a system service that runs the Nethermind Ethereum client. 

The script starts by defining two variables `On_Green` and `Color_Off` that are used to color the output of the script. The `On_Green` variable sets the background color of the output to green, while the `Color_Off` variable resets the color to the default. 

The script then prints a message to the console indicating that the `nethermind.service` is being restarted. This message is colored green using the `On_Green` variable. 

The `restartNethermind()` function is then defined. This function uses the `systemctl` command to restart the `nethermind.service`. The `sudo` command is used to run the `systemctl` command with root privileges. 

After the function is defined, it is called to restart the `nethermind.service`. 

Finally, a message is printed to the console indicating that the restart was successful. This message is also colored green using the `On_Green` variable. 

This script can be used to automate the process of restarting the `nethermind.service` on a Linux system. It can be integrated into a larger deployment or monitoring system to ensure that the Nethermind Ethereum client is always running. 

Example usage:

```
$ ./restart_nethermind.sh
 Restarting the nethermind.service...
 OK
```
