The code above defines a function called `tailLogs` that reads and outputs the contents of log files in real-time. The function uses the `tail` command to follow the end of the log files and output any new lines that are added to them. The log files are specified using a file path pattern stored in the `LOG_PATH` variable. 

This code can be used in the larger Nethermind project to monitor and debug the application's behavior. By tailing the log files, developers can observe the application's output and identify any errors or issues that may arise during runtime. This can be particularly useful in a distributed system like Nethermind, where multiple nodes are running simultaneously and generating log files. 

To use this code in the Nethermind project, developers can simply call the `tailLogs` function from the command line or from within another script. For example, if a developer wants to monitor the logs of a specific node, they can navigate to the node's log directory and run the `tailLogs` function with the appropriate file path pattern. 

```
cd /path/to/node/logs
tailLogs "node*.log.txt"
```

This will output the contents of all log files that match the pattern `node*.log.txt` in real-time. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to monitor log files in real-time, which can be a valuable tool for debugging and troubleshooting in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a function `tailLogs()` that tails the logs located in the `data/logs` directory and then calls the function.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier and SPDX-FileCopyrightText comments?
   - These comments indicate the license under which the code is released and the copyright holder.

3. What is the expected format of the log files that this code is tailing?
   - The code expects the log files to have a `.logs.txt` extension and be located in the `data/logs` directory.
