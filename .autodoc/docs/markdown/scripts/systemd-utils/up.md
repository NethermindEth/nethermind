This code is a shell script that starts the Nethermind service. Nethermind is a client implementation of the Ethereum blockchain written in C#. The script begins by setting two variables, `On_Green` and `Color_Off`, which are used to colorize the output of the script. The `On_Green` variable sets the background color to green, while the `Color_Off` variable resets the color to the default.

The script then prints a message to the console indicating that the Nethermind service is starting. This message is colorized using the `On_Green` and `Color_Off` variables. 

The `startNethermind()` function is then defined, which starts the Nethermind service using the `systemctl` command. The `sudo` command is used to run the `systemctl` command with elevated privileges.

Finally, the `startNethermind()` function is called, which starts the Nethermind service. Another message is printed to the console indicating that the service has started successfully.

This script is likely used as part of a larger project that requires the Nethermind service to be started automatically. It could be included in a deployment script or run as part of a startup script for a server. 

Example usage:

```
$ ./start_nethermind.sh
 Starting nethermind service...
 OK
```
