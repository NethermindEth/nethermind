The `Program` class in the `HiveConsensusWorkflowGenerator` namespace is responsible for generating a YAML file that defines a GitHub Actions workflow for running consensus tests on the Nethermind Ethereum client. The generated YAML file is saved to the `.github/workflows` directory of the Nethermind repository and is used to automate the testing process.

The `Program` class contains a `Main` method that serves as the entry point for the program. The method takes an optional command-line argument that specifies the path to the directory containing the consensus tests. If no argument is provided, the default path is set to `src/tests`.

The `Main` method calls several private methods to perform the following tasks:

1. Get the directories containing the consensus tests.
2. Determine which tests need to be run based on their size.
3. Split the tests into jobs that can be run in parallel.
4. Write the YAML file that defines the GitHub Actions workflow.

The `GetTestsDirectories` method retrieves the directories containing the consensus tests by searching for directories with names that start with "st" or "bc" in the specified path. The method returns an `IEnumerable<string>` containing the directory paths.

The `FindDirectory` method searches for a directory with the specified name in the current directory and its parent directories. The method returns the path of the first directory that matches the search pattern.

The `CreateTextWriter` method creates a `TextWriter` object that writes to the YAML file. The method uses the `FindDirectory` method to get the path of the `.github/workflows` directory and creates a `FileStream` object to write to the YAML file.

The `GetPathsToBeTested` method determines which tests need to be run based on their size. The method takes an `IEnumerable<string>` containing the directory paths and returns a `Dictionary<string, long>` containing the paths of the tests to be run and their sizes. The method first calculates the total size of each directory and adds it to a `Dictionary<string, long>`. If the total size of a directory is greater than `MaxSizeWithoutSplitting`, the method splits the directory into individual tests and adds them to the `Dictionary<string, long>`.

The `GetTestsSplittedToJobs` method splits the tests into jobs that can be run in parallel. The method takes a `Dictionary<string, long>` containing the paths of the tests to be run and their sizes and returns an `IEnumerable<List<string>>` containing the tests split into jobs. The method splits the tests into jobs based on their size and adds a penalty for additional initialization time. The method returns a list of tests for each job.

The `WriteInitialLines` method writes the initial lines of the YAML file that define the name of the workflow and the events that trigger the workflow.

The `WriteJob` method writes the YAML code for each job. The method takes a `TextWriter` object, a `List<string>` containing the tests to be run in the job, and an integer representing the job number. The method writes the YAML code for each step in the job, including setting up the environment, building the Docker image, and running the tests. The method also writes the name of the job and the number of the job to the YAML file.

In summary, the `Program` class generates a YAML file that defines a GitHub Actions workflow for running consensus tests on the Nethermind Ethereum client. The class uses several private methods to retrieve the directories containing the tests, determine which tests need to be run, split the tests into jobs, and write the YAML file. The generated YAML file can be used to automate the testing process and ensure that the Nethermind Ethereum client is functioning correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code generates a YAML file for a GitHub workflow that runs consensus tests for the Nethermind Ethereum client using the Hive simulator.

2. What are the input requirements for this code?
    
    The code takes an optional command line argument specifying the path to the directory containing the blockchain tests. If no argument is provided, it defaults to "src/tests".

3. What is the expected output of this code?
    
    The expected output of this code is a YAML file containing a GitHub workflow that runs consensus tests for the Nethermind Ethereum client using the Hive simulator. The workflow is split into multiple jobs, each running a subset of the tests. The results of the tests are printed at the end of the workflow.
