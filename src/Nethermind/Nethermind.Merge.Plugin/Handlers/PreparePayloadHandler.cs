    /// engine_preparePayload. Notifies an execution client that the consensus client will need to propose a block
    /// at some point in the future and that the payload will be requested by the corresponding engine_getPayload
    /// near to that point in time. This call also supplies an execution client with inputs required to produce
    /// a payload e.g. random.
    /// One of the purposes of this call is giving an execution client some time to get prepared to the subsequent
    /// engine_getPayload call that is required to be responded immediately with the most up-to-date version of
    /// the payload that is available by the time of the get call.
    /// One of the potential implementations of this method would be initiating a payload building process
    /// that builds an execution payload on top of a given parent with transactions selected from the mempool
    /// and arguments provided in the parameter set of the call. And then would keep this payload updated with
    /// the most recent state of the mempool.
    /// As the first action, it is recommended for implementations to build a payload with empty transaction
    /// set as a backup in order to be able to respond immediately if the corresponding engine_getPayload
    /// call happens e.g. 10ms after the prepare one which could be the case.
    /// Execution client should cancel the process of payload building
    /// (if there is a constant process of updating the payload) if SECONDS_PER_SLOT seconds have passed since
    /// the timestamp specified in the call. This suggestion is made to protect execution client from wasting
    /// resources in the edge case when related engine_getPayload call never happens.
    /// If the corresponding engine_getPayload call happens after the cancellation it should be responded with error.
    /// Related engine_getPayload call will likely happen very close to the timestamp.
    /// Execution client may use this information to choose the strategy of building a payload.
    /// A pair of engine_preparePayload and engine_getPayload related to each other are identified by the payload_id
    /// parameter. Consensus client implementations are free to use whatever value of the identifier they find reasonable.
