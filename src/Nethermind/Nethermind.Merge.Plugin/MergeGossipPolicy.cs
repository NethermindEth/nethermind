                                            However, in edge case situation (verified by merge hive tests), our node needs to be reorged to PoW again, so we can't add this condition _blockCacheService.FinalizedHash != Keccak.Zero
                                            to PoSSwitcher.TransitionFinished. On the other hand, we don't want to receive any blocks from the network, so we want to discard blocks. */
