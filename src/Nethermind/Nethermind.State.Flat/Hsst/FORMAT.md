# HSST — Hierarchical Static Sorted Table

A compact, immutable binary format for sorted key/value tables.

## Document guideline

- This document specifies the **byte format** only. It must not reference any
  implementation type, method, file path, or other code artefact. If you need
  to describe how a particular reader/writer/iterator works, that belongs in
  source-code comments, not here. The format must be readable in isolation.

## Aim

- **Indexable blob.** An HSST is a self-contained byte sequence that can be
  point-queried (by key) without loading the whole blob — readers walk an
  embedded B-tree index from the tail to descend to the entry they want.
- **Hierarchical.** A value associated with a key may itself be an HSST blob
  ("nested HSST"). This is the expected shape, not a corner case: a column
  whose values are inner tables uses one outer HSST plus N inner HSSTs. Two
  consequences fall out of allowing values to be large:
  1. **Metadata sits *after* its value.** With variable-length values that
     can be many KiB or MiB long, putting a length prefix in front would
     force readers to consume the length even when they only want the
     adjacent metadata. Trailing metadata lets the reader pivot directly off
     the metadata cursor and back-decode the value's start.
  2. **Inner-HSST indexes end up next to the outer metadata.** The B-tree
     index of an HSST lives at the *end* of the blob. So when a value is
     itself an HSST, its index sits at the tail of the value bytes — i.e.,
     immediately before the outer entry's metadata. A reader that descends
     into a nested HSST and then ascends back to the outer level needs only
     the bytes near the cursor; the layout makes that locality natural.
- **Easy to iterate, hence easy to merge.** Entries within a node are sorted
  by key, and the B-tree imposes the same total order across nodes. Readers
  can walk an HSST left-to-right in sorted key order without buffering, and
  N-way merges of independent HSSTs need only one cursor per source.

## Top-level layout

| Variant | Bytes |
|---|---|
| **BTree** | `[Data Region][Index Region][IndexType: u8 = 0x01]` |
| **BTreeInlineValue** | `[Index Region][IndexType: u8 = 0x02]` |
| **BTreeHashIndex** | `[Data Region][Index Region][HashTable: 4·2^L bytes][TableSizeLog2: u8 = L][IndexType: u8 = 0x03]` |
| **BTreeNodeHashIndex** | `[Data Region][Index Region][NodeHashTable: 4·2^L bytes][TableSizeLog2: u8 = L][IndexType: u8 = 0x04]` |
| **BTreeNodeHashIndexInlineValue** | `[Index Region][NodeHashTable: 4·2^L bytes][TableSizeLog2: u8 = L][IndexType: u8 = 0x05]` |

The trailing **index type byte** is the last byte of the HSST and selects
the variant by enumerated value (not a bitfield):

| Value | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `BTree` | Separate data region; leaves hold metaStart pointers. |
| `0x02` | `BTreeInlineValue` | No data region; leaves hold values inline. |
| `0x03` | `BTreeHashIndex` | `BTree` plus a trailing open-address hash table of metaStart pointers. |
| `0x04` | `BTreeNodeHashIndex` | `BTree` plus a trailing hash table of leaf-node pointers. |
| `0x05` | `BTreeNodeHashIndexInlineValue` | `BTreeInlineValue` plus a trailing hash table of leaf-node pointers. |

Other values are reserved for future index strategies. The root B-tree
node lives just before the index type byte (or just before the hash table,
for `BTreeHashIndex`) and is read backward via its trailing `MetadataLength`
byte; there is no header.

### BTree variant

The data region is a packed sequence of variable-length, **self-describing**
entries laid out value-first so that decoding is forward-readable from a
known `MetadataStart` cursor:

```
[Value: V bytes][ValueLength: LEB128][KeyLength: u8][FullKey: K bytes]
                ^
                MetadataStart  (= the index pointer's target byte)
```

`MetadataStart` is the byte offset (within the HSST buffer, measured from
byte 0 — the first byte of the data region) of the `ValueLength` LEB128.
The leaf B-tree node stores this offset for every entry; readers seek into
the leaf, take the metaStart pointer, then:

1. Decode `ValueLength` (LEB128) — the value bytes live at
   `[MetadataStart - ValueLength, MetadataStart)`.
2. Read `KeyLength` (single `u8`, 0–255).
3. The full key sits at `[MetadataStart + lebBytes + 1, MetadataStart + lebBytes + 1 + KeyLength)`.

**Why `MetadataStart` aims at `ValueLength` and not at the value.** Values
are unbounded (KiB–MiB, including nested HSSTs) so `ValueLength` is LEB128.
LEB128 has a forward-only terminator (high-bit "continuation" chain): given
a byte mid-stream you can't tell whether you're inside someone else's
continuation run or sitting at the start of a fresh varint. So the format
places the length *after* the value and aims the index pointer at it; the
value is back-derived from `MetadataStart - ValueLength`. The fixed-width
`KeyLength` then `FullKey` are forward-decoded after that. This is a
load-bearing invariant — the entry tail must keep `MetadataStart` as the
value↔length pivot.

**Separator vs. full key.** The leaf B-tree node *also* stores a
**separator** for each entry — a min-length prefix chosen against the
entry's neighbours, used purely to drive in-leaf binary search. The
data-region entry is self-describing (carries the full key), so a reader
doesn't need to combine separator + suffix; it can decode the full key
directly from the entry tail. This costs `separator.Length` extra bytes
per entry (the prefix is duplicated) in exchange for: simpler decoding,
no per-entry key reconstruction during iteration, and entries that can be
recovered from just `(buffer, MetadataStart)` without consulting any
index.

### BTreeInlineValue variant

There is no data region. Leaf B-tree nodes hold the values directly inside
the keys section's value slots. Separators in inline-mode leaves **are** the
full keys (no key reconstruction). Used for small fixed-width values where
the index-vs-data split would waste space — e.g. storage slot suffixes.

### BTreeHashIndex variant

A `BTree` with an extra open-address hash table appended after the root.
Layout, reading backward from the index type byte:

```
... B-tree root ... [HashTable][TableSizeLog2: u8 = L][IndexType: u8 = 0x03]
```

- `TableSizeLog2` (`L`) is a single byte; the table holds exactly `2^L`
  slots. `L` is in `[0, 31]`.
- `HashTable` is `2^L` slots of `u32` little-endian, each one of:
  - `0x00000000` — **empty**: no entry hashes to this slot.
  - `0xFFFFFFFF` — **collision sentinel**: two or more entries hashed here;
    the reader must consult the B-tree.
  - any other value — a `MetadataStart` pointer with the same encoding as a
    non-inline B-tree leaf value (see "BTree variant"): byte offset relative
    to byte 0 of the HSST.

Slot index for a key:

```
slot = HashKey(key) & ((1 << L) - 1)
```

Where `HashKey` is the low 32 bits of `XxHash3` over the full key bytes
(no prefix stripping); writer and reader must compute it identically.

The empty sentinel is unambiguous because in a valid `BTreeHashIndex` HSST
the data region is non-empty (an empty HSST is encoded as plain `BTree`),
so a real `MetadataStart` is always nonzero. The collision sentinel
`0xFFFFFFFF` is unambiguous because `MetadataStart` for a single HSST
cannot reach `2^32 - 1` (the HSST is bounded by the surrounding 4-byte
B-tree pointer encoding, ≈2 GiB).

**Lookup procedure.** Compute `slot`. Read the slot value:

1. **Empty.** No entry could match; exact lookup returns "not found". A
   floor lookup must still consult the B-tree.
2. **Collision.** Multiple keys hashed to this slot; consult the B-tree.
3. **Pointer.** Resolve the candidate exactly as for a non-inline B-tree
   leaf hit: decode `ValueLength`/`KeyLength` at the `MetadataStart` cursor
   and compare the stored key to the input. On match, return; on mismatch
   (the candidate's hash collides with the input's hash), exact lookup
   returns "not found" and floor must consult the B-tree.

**Sizing.** Builders pick the smallest `2^L` such that
`N / 2^L ≤ targetUtilization` (default target `0.75`); the target is a
build-time knob, never recorded in the file.

The B-tree under the hash table is identical to a `BTree` HSST and remains
authoritative — readers that only know `BTree` could parse this variant by
peeling off the trailing `2 + 4·2^L` bytes and reading the rest as a
`BTree` HSST. The hash table is purely a fast path.

### BTreeNodeHashIndex / BTreeNodeHashIndexInlineValue variants

Same shape as `BTreeHashIndex` (table of `2^L` little-endian `u32` slots
followed by `TableSizeLog2` then the discriminator byte), but the slot's
non-sentinel value is the **inclusive last-byte offset of a leaf node**
within the HSST — the same encoding used by intermediate B-tree
child-pointers. `BTreeNodeHashIndex` (0x04) sits over a non-inline B-tree;
`BTreeNodeHashIndexInlineValue` (0x05) sits over a `BTreeInlineValue`
B-tree.

Slot semantics:

- `0x00000000` — empty: no key in the HSST hashes to this slot.
- `0xFFFFFFFF` — collision: two or more **distinct** leaf nodes share this
  slot; the reader must consult the B-tree.
- otherwise — leaf-node end offset. Multiple keys that share a leaf
  collapse onto the same slot value (this is not a collision); only
  distinct leaves on the same slot trigger the sentinel.

Slot index is computed identically to `BTreeHashIndex`
(`slot = HashKey(key) & ((1 << L) - 1)`). The empty sentinel is
unambiguous because a leaf node's last-byte offset is never 0 (an empty
HSST is encoded as plain `BTree`).

**Lookup procedure.** Compute `slot`; read the slot value:

1. **Empty.** Exact-match returns "not found"; floor must consult the
   B-tree.
2. **Collision.** Consult the B-tree.
3. **Leaf pointer.** Load the indicated leaf node and run the in-leaf
   binary search exactly as the B-tree walk would for that leaf. On exact
   match, decode the value (from the data region for `0x04`, from the
   leaf's value section for `0x05`); on miss, exact-match returns "not
   found" (the slot is authoritative — the key would have been built into
   the same slot value or marked collision). Floor must consult the
   B-tree because a floor inside the hashed leaf is not necessarily the
   global floor.

**Sizing.** Builders pick the smallest `2^L` such that
`leafCount / 2^L ≤ targetUtilization` — the table population is bounded
by the number of distinct leaves, not the entry count, so the table is
typically much smaller than a `BTreeHashIndex` over the same data.

## B-tree index node layout

Each node (root, intermediate, or leaf) ends with a trailing `MetadataLength`
byte. Reading an index node backward from its exclusive-end offset:

```
[Values section][Keys section][Metadata][MetadataLength: u8]
                                                          ^
                                                          end of node
```

### Metadata

```
[Flags: u8][KeyCount: LEB128][KeySize: LEB128][ValueSize: LEB128][BaseOffset: LEB128 optional][CommonKeyPrefixLen: u8 + bytes optional]
```

`Flags` bits:

| Bit  | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | `IsIntermediate` — 1 = intermediate B-tree node, 0 = leaf |
| 1–2  | `KeyType`        — 0 Variable / 1 Uniform / 2 UniformWithLen |
| 3–4  | `ValueType`      — 0 Variable / 1 Uniform / 2 UniformWithLen |
| 5    | `HasBaseOffset`  — 1 = `BaseOffset` LEB128 follows |
| 6    | `HasCommonKeyPrefix` — 1 = `CommonKeyPrefixLen` (u8) + prefix bytes follow |
| 7    | `HasFlagsContinuation` — 1 = a second flags byte follows the first, reserved for future expansion. Current writers always emit 0; current readers may reject `1` as unsupported. |

When `HasCommonKeyPrefix` is set, every stored key in the node equals
`CommonKeyPrefix || suffix_i` where `suffix_i` is what the keys section
encodes. `KeySize` / slot semantics apply to the *suffixes* — `Uniform` slot
size is `commonSuffixLen`, `UniformWithLen` slot is `maxSuffixLen + 1`,
`Variable` section size covers only suffix LEB-prefixed bytes plus the
offset table. The prefix bytes live entirely inside metadata; section size
math is unchanged. Writers cap the prefix at **128 bytes** so the metadata
stays well under the `MetadataLength` u8 ceiling, and only emit it when
`prefixLen × (count − 1) > 1` (i.e. it strictly pays back its
`1 + prefixLen` overhead) and when at least one suffix is non-empty.

`KeySize` / `ValueSize` semantics depend on the corresponding type:

- **Variable (0)** — the value of `KeySize`/`ValueSize` is the *section's*
  total byte size. The section holds `LEB128 length || bytes` per entry at
  the front, followed by a `KeyCount * 2`-byte little-endian offset table at
  the **end** of the section. Offsets are relative to the section's start
  (i.e. the first entry sits at offset 0). The maximum addressable section
  data region is therefore 64 KiB; the writer rejects nodes that would
  exceed it.
- **Uniform (1)** — packed fixed-width entries. Each entry is exactly
  `KeySize` (or `ValueSize`) bytes; section size is `KeyCount * size`.
- **UniformWithLen (2)** — fixed slot size, but the last byte of each slot
  records the actual byte length used. Section size still `KeyCount * size`.

`BaseOffset`, when present, is added to every integer value read out of the
node. This lets intermediate nodes and leaves with metaStart-pointers store
offsets in 4 bytes even when the underlying buffer is larger than the
naive `int` range: pick a base near the cluster of values and store small
deltas off it.

### Children pointers (intermediate nodes)

For an intermediate node, each value is a 4-byte little-endian `int`
(Uniform, 4) interpreted (after `+ BaseOffset`) as the **inclusive last
byte** of the referenced child node within the HSST buffer (0-indexed from
the first byte of the HSST). The child's exclusive end = `childOffset + 1`;
the reader then loads the child from the end the same way it loaded the root.

### Metadata-start pointers (non-inline leaves)

For a non-inline leaf node, each value is a 4-byte little-endian `int`
(after `+ BaseOffset`) giving the entry's `MetadataStart`, *relative to the
start of the data region* (i.e. byte 0 of the HSST is the first byte of the
data region).

### Inline values (`BTreeInlineValue` leaves)

For `BTreeInlineValue` leaves, each value-section slot holds the full value
bytes directly — there's no metaStart indirection.

## Constraints

- Maximum entries per leaf node: **64** by default; configurable at write
  time. Beyond that, the writer splits the leaf and promotes a separator
  into an intermediate node.
- Maximum key length per entry: **255 bytes**, encoded as a single `u8`.
  Writers must reject longer keys.
- `MetadataLength` is a single byte → metadata section ≤ 255 bytes.
- All offsets *within* a node are encoded as 4-byte little-endian
  integers, so a single HSST is capped at ≈2 GiB. There is no in-format
  cap on a containing host file holding many HSSTs.

## Affected files

When changing this format, every file below has byte-level knowledge of
the layout and must be reviewed in lockstep with this document. If you
add a new file that encodes or decodes HSST bytes, append it here.

Writers / encoders:
- `Hsst/HsstBuilder.cs` — top-level HSST builder; writes the data region,
  drives the index builder, appends the trailing `IndexType` byte.
- `Hsst/HsstIndexBuilder.cs` — drives B-tree shape (leaf splitting,
  intermediate-node promotion).
- `Hsst/HsstIndexNodeWriter.cs` — writes a single index node's bytes
  (`Values | Keys | Metadata | MetadataLength`).
- `BSearchIndex/BSearchIndexWriter.cs` — alternate node writer used by
  the merge path; must stay byte-compatible with `HsstIndexNodeWriter`.
- `BSearchIndex/BSearchIndexLayoutPlanner.cs` — picks key/value section
  encodings (Variable / Uniform / UniformWithLen) and section sizes.
- `Hsst/IndexType.cs` — enum of valid index-type byte values.

Readers / decoders:
- `Hsst/HsstReader.cs` — point-query reader; reads the trailing
  `IndexType` byte and walks the B-tree from the tail.
- `Hsst/HsstIndex.cs` — parses a single index node from its tail.
- `BSearchIndex/BSearchIndexReader.cs` — alternate index-node decoder
  used by the merge path; mirrors `HsstIndex` parsing.
- `BSearchIndex/BSearchIndexReaderSimd.cs` — SIMD fast paths over
  fixed-width key/value sections; tied to the section encodings the
  layout planner can choose.

Iterators:
- `Hsst/HsstEnumerator.cs` — forward iterator over a whole HSST scope;
  reads the trailing `IndexType` byte, descends to the leftmost leaf,
  and walks key-sorted entries via end-anchored ancestor frames.
- `Hsst/HsstMergeEnumerator.cs` — N-way-merge cursor; collects every
  leaf entry's `(separator, metaStart-or-inline-value)` up-front so a
  sort-merge can round-robin many cursors without per-step allocations.

Size / capacity math:
- `PersistedSnapshots/HsstSizeEstimator.cs` — every constant here
  (minimum HSST size, per-entry overhead, per-leaf overhead) tracks the
  bytes the builder actually emits. Update whenever the wire layout
  gains or loses bytes.

Tests that pin the wire format (rename / re-anchor when bytes move):
- `Nethermind.State.Flat.Test/Hsst/HsstTests.cs` —
  `IndexType_Byte_Is_BTree_At_Tail` and round-trip tests.
- `Nethermind.State.Flat.Test/Hsst/HsstReaderTests.cs` —
  `IndexType_Byte_Is_BTree_ReaderWorks`.
- `Nethermind.State.Flat.Test/BSearchIndex/BSearchIndexTests.cs` — hex
  fixture tests for individual index nodes; `ReadFromEnd(data, …)` call
  sites are sensitive to where the trailing byte sits.
