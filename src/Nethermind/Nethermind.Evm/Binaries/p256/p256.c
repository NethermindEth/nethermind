 *
 * # Hash Functions
 *
 * This file documents the API for hash functions.
 *
 *
 * ## Procedural API
 *
 * For each implemented hash function, of name "`xxx`", the following
 * elements are defined:
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_vtable`
 *
 *     An externally defined instance of `br_hash_class`.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_SIZE`
 *
 *     A macro that evaluates to the output size (in bytes) of the
 *     hash function.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ID`
 *
 *     A macro that evaluates to a symbolic identifier for the hash
 *     function. Such identifiers are used with HMAC and signature
 *     algorithm implementations.
 *
 *     NOTE: for the "standard" hash functions defined in [the TLS
 *     standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.1.4.1),
 *     the symbolic identifiers match the constants used in TLS, i.e.
 *     1 to 6 for MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512,
 *     respectively.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_context`
 *
 *     Context for an ongoing computation. It is allocated by the
 *     caller, and a pointer to it is passed to all functions. A
 *     context contains no interior pointer, so it can be moved around
 *     and cloned (with a simple `memcpy()` or equivalent) in order to
 *     capture the function state at some point. Computations that use
 *     distinct context structures are independent of each other. The
 *     first field of `br_xxx_context` is always a pointer to the
 *     `br_xxx_vtable` structure; `br_xxx_init()` sets that pointer.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_init(br_xxx_context *ctx)`
 *
 *     Initialise the provided context. Previous contents of the structure
 *     are ignored. This calls resets the context to the start of a new
 *     hash computation; it also sets the first field of the context
 *     structure (called `vtable`) to a pointer to the statically
 *     allocated constant `br_xxx_vtable` structure.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_update(br_xxx_context *ctx, const void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Add some more bytes to the hash computation represented by the
 *     provided context.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_out(const br_xxx_context *ctx, void *out)`
 *
 *     Complete the hash computation and write the result in the provided
 *     buffer. The output buffer MUST be large enough to accommodate the
 *     result. The context is NOT modified by this operation, so this
 *     function can be used to get a "partial hash" while still keeping
 *     the possibility of adding more bytes to the input.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_state(const br_xxx_context *ctx, void *out)`
 *
 *     Get a copy of the "current state" for the computation so far. For
 *     MD functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 family), this is the running state
 *     resulting from the processing of the last complete input block.
 *     Returned value is the current input length (in bytes).
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_set_state(br_xxx_context *ctx, const void *stb, uint64_t count)`
 *
 *     Set the internal state to the provided values. The 'stb' and
 *     'count' values shall match that which was obtained from
 *     `br_xxx_state()`. This restores the hash state only if the state
 *     values were at an appropriate block boundary. This does NOT set
 *     the `vtable` pointer in the context.
 *
 * Context structures can be discarded without any explicit deallocation.
 * Hash function implementations are purely software and don't reserve
 * any resources outside of the context structure itself.
 *
 *
 * ## Object-Oriented API
 *
 * For each hash function that follows the procedural API described
 * above, an object-oriented API is also provided. In that API, function
 * pointers from the vtable (`br_xxx_vtable`) are used. The vtable
 * incarnates object-oriented programming. An introduction on the OOP
 * concept used here can be read on the BearSSL Web site:<br />
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://www.bearssl.org/oop.html](https://www.bearssl.org/oop.html)
 *
 * The vtable offers functions called `init()`, `update()`, `out()`,
 * `set()` and `set_state()`, which are in fact the functions from
 * the procedural API. That vtable also contains two informative fields:
 *
 *   - `context_size`
 *
 *     The size of the context structure (`br_xxx_context`), in bytes.
 *     This can be used by generic implementations to perform dynamic
 *     context allocation.
 *
 *   - `desc`
 *
 *     A "descriptor" field that encodes some information on the hash
 *     function: symbolic identifier, output size, state size,
 *     internal block size, details on the padding.
 *
 * Users of this object-oriented API (in particular generic HMAC
 * implementations) may make the following assumptions:
 *
 *   - Hash output size is no more than 64 bytes.
 *   - Hash internal state size is no more than 64 bytes.
 *   - Internal block size is a power of two, no less than 16 and no more
 *     than 256.
 *
 *
 * ## Implemented Hash Functions
 *
 * Implemented hash functions are:
 *
 * | Function  | Name    | Output length | State length |
 * | :-------- | :------ | :-----------: | :----------: |
 * | MD5       | md5     |     16        |     16       |
 * | SHA-1     | sha1    |     20        |     20       |
 * | SHA-224   | sha224  |     28        |     32       |
 * | SHA-256   | sha256  |     32        |     32       |
 * | SHA-384   | sha384  |     48        |     64       |
 * | SHA-512   | sha512  |     64        |     64       |
 * | MD5+SHA-1 | md5sha1 |     36        |     36       |
 *
 * (MD5+SHA-1 is the concatenation of MD5 and SHA-1 computed over the
 * same input; in the implementation, the internal data buffer is
 * shared, thus making it more memory-efficient than separate MD5 and
 * SHA-1. It can be useful in implementing SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS
 * 1.1.)
 *
 *
 * ## Multi-Hasher
 *
 * An aggregate hasher is provided, that can compute several standard
 * hash functions in parallel. It uses `br_multihash_context` and a
 * procedural API. It is configured with the implementations (the vtables)
 * that it should use; it will then compute all these hash functions in
 * parallel, on the same input. It is meant to be used in cases when the
 * hash of an object will be used, but the exact hash function is not
 * known yet (typically, streamed processing on X.509 certificates).
 *
 * Only the standard hash functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384
 * and SHA-512) are supported by the multi-hasher.
 *
 *
 * ## GHASH
 *
 * GHASH is not a generic hash function; it is a _universal_ hash function,
 * which, as the name does not say, means that it CANNOT be used in most
 * places where a hash function is needed. GHASH is used within the GCM
 * encryption mode, to provide the checked integrity functionality.
 *
 * A GHASH implementation is basically a function that uses the type defined
 * in this file under the name `br_ghash`:
 *
 *     typedef void (*br_ghash)(void *y, const void *h, const void *data, size_t len);
 *
 * The `y` pointer refers to a 16-byte value which is used as input, and
 * receives the output of the GHASH invocation. `h` is a 16-byte secret
 * value (that serves as key). `data` and `len` define the input data.
 *
 * Three GHASH implementations are provided, all constant-time, based on
 * the use of integer multiplications with appropriate masking to cancel
 * carry propagation.
 */

/**
 * \brief Class type for hash function implementations.
 *
 * A `br_hash_class` instance references the methods implementing a hash
 * function. Constant instances of this structure are defined for each

 *
 * Vtables are used to support object-oriented programming, as
 * described on [the BearSSL Web site](https://www.bearssl.org/oop.html).

 * # Block Ciphers and Symmetric Ciphers
 *
 * This file documents the API for block ciphers and other symmetric
 * ciphers.
 *
 *
 * ## Procedural API
 *
 * For a block cipher implementation, up to three separate sets of
 * functions are provided, for CBC encryption, CBC decryption, and CTR
 * encryption/decryption. Each set has its own context structure,
 * initialised with the encryption key.
 *
 * For CBC encryption and decryption, the data to encrypt or decrypt is
 * referenced as a sequence of blocks. The implementations assume that
 * there is no partial block; no padding is applied or removed. The
 * caller is responsible for handling any kind of padding.
 *
 * Function for CTR encryption are defined only for block ciphers with
 * blocks of 16 bytes or more (i.e. AES, but not DES/3DES).
 *
 * Each implemented block cipher is identified by an "internal name"
 * from which are derived the names of structures and functions that
 * implement the cipher. For the block cipher of internal name "`xxx`",
 * the following are defined:
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_BLOCK_SIZE`
 *
 *     A macro that evaluates to the block size (in bytes) of the
 *     cipher. For all implemented block ciphers, this value is a
 *     power of two.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcenc_keys`
 *
 *     Context structure that contains the subkeys resulting from the key
 *     expansion. These subkeys are appropriate for CBC encryption. The
 *     structure first field is called `vtable` and points to the
 *     appropriate OOP structure.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcenc_init(br_xxx_cbcenc_keys *ctx, const void *key, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform key expansion: subkeys for CBC encryption are computed and
 *     written in the provided context structure. The key length MUST be
 *     adequate for the implemented block cipher. This function also sets
 *     the `vtable` field.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcenc_run(const br_xxx_cbcenc_keys *ctx, void *iv, void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform CBC encryption of `len` bytes, in place. The encrypted data
 *     replaces the cleartext. `len` MUST be a multiple of the block length
 *     (if it is not, the function may loop forever or overflow a buffer).
 *     The IV is provided with the `iv` pointer; it is also updated with
 *     a copy of the last encrypted block.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcdec_keys`
 *
 *     Context structure that contains the subkeys resulting from the key
 *     expansion. These subkeys are appropriate for CBC decryption. The
 *     structure first field is called `vtable` and points to the
 *     appropriate OOP structure.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcdec_init(br_xxx_cbcenc_keys *ctx, const void *key, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform key expansion: subkeys for CBC decryption are computed and
 *     written in the provided context structure. The key length MUST be
 *     adequate for the implemented block cipher. This function also sets
 *     the `vtable` field.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcdec_run(const br_xxx_cbcdec_keys *ctx, void *iv, void *data, size_t num_blocks)`
 *
 *     Perform CBC decryption of `len` bytes, in place. The decrypted data
 *     replaces the ciphertext. `len` MUST be a multiple of the block length
 *     (if it is not, the function may loop forever or overflow a buffer).
 *     The IV is provided with the `iv` pointer; it is also updated with
 *     a copy of the last _encrypted_ block.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctr_keys`
 *
 *     Context structure that contains the subkeys resulting from the key
 *     expansion. These subkeys are appropriate for CTR encryption and
 *     decryption. The structure first field is called `vtable` and
 *     points to the appropriate OOP structure.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctr_init(br_xxx_ctr_keys *ctx, const void *key, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform key expansion: subkeys for CTR encryption and decryption
 *     are computed and written in the provided context structure. The
 *     key length MUST be adequate for the implemented block cipher. This
 *     function also sets the `vtable` field.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctr_run(const br_xxx_ctr_keys *ctx, const void *iv, uint32_t cc, void *data, size_t len)` (returns `uint32_t`)
 *
 *     Perform CTR encryption/decryption of some data. Processing is done
 *     "in place" (the output data replaces the input data). This function
 *     implements the "standard incrementing function" from NIST SP800-38A,
 *     annex B: the IV length shall be 4 bytes less than the block size
 *     (i.e. 12 bytes for AES) and the counter is the 32-bit value starting
 *     with `cc`. The data length (`len`) is not necessarily a multiple of
 *     the block size. The new counter value is returned, which supports
 *     chunked processing, provided that each chunk length (except possibly
 *     the last one) is a multiple of the block size.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_keys`
 *
 *     Context structure that contains the subkeys resulting from the
 *     key expansion. These subkeys are appropriate for doing combined
 *     CTR encryption/decryption and CBC-MAC, as used in the CCM and EAX
 *     authenticated encryption modes. The structure first field is
 *     called `vtable` and points to the appropriate OOP structure.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_init(br_xxx_ctr_keys *ctx, const void *key, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform key expansion: subkeys for combined CTR
 *     encryption/decryption and CBC-MAC are computed and written in the
 *     provided context structure. The key length MUST be adequate for
 *     the implemented block cipher. This function also sets the
 *     `vtable` field.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_encrypt(const br_xxx_ctrcbc_keys *ctx, void *ctr, void *cbcmac, void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform CTR encryption of some data, and CBC-MAC. Processing is
 *     done "in place" (the output data replaces the input data). This
 *     function applies CTR encryption on the data, using a full
 *     block-size counter (i.e. for 128-bit blocks, the counter is
 *     incremented as a 128-bit value). The 'ctr' array contains the
 *     initial value for the counter (used in the first block) and it is
 *     updated with the new value after data processing. The 'cbcmac'
 *     value shall point to a block-sized value which is used as IV for
 *     CBC-MAC, computed over the encrypted data (output of CTR
 *     encryption); the resulting CBC-MAC is written over 'cbcmac' on
 *     output.
 *
 *     The data length MUST be a multiple of the block size.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_decrypt(const br_xxx_ctrcbc_keys *ctx, void *ctr, void *cbcmac, void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform CTR decryption of some data, and CBC-MAC. Processing is
 *     done "in place" (the output data replaces the input data). This
 *     function applies CTR decryption on the data, using a full
 *     block-size counter (i.e. for 128-bit blocks, the counter is
 *     incremented as a 128-bit value). The 'ctr' array contains the
 *     initial value for the counter (used in the first block) and it is
 *     updated with the new value after data processing. The 'cbcmac'
 *     value shall point to a block-sized value which is used as IV for
 *     CBC-MAC, computed over the encrypted data (input of CTR
 *     encryption); the resulting CBC-MAC is written over 'cbcmac' on
 *     output.
 *
 *     The data length MUST be a multiple of the block size.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_ctr(const br_xxx_ctrcbc_keys *ctx, void *ctr, void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Perform CTR encryption or decryption of the provided data. The
 *     data is processed "in place" (the output data replaces the input
 *     data). A full block-sized counter is applied (i.e. for 128-bit
 *     blocks, the counter is incremented as a 128-bit value). The 'ctr'
 *     array contains the initial value for the counter (used in the
 *     first block), and it is updated with the new value after data
 *     processing.
 *
 *     The data length MUST be a multiple of the block size.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_mac(const br_xxx_ctrcbc_keys *ctx, void *cbcmac, const void *data, size_t len)`
 *
 *     Compute CBC-MAC over the provided data. The IV for CBC-MAC is
 *     provided as 'cbcmac'; the output is written over the same array.
 *     The data itself is untouched. The data length MUST be a multiple
 *     of the block size.
 *
 *
 * It shall be noted that the key expansion functions return `void`. If
 * the provided key length is not allowed, then there will be no error
 * reporting; implementations need not validate the key length, thus an
 * invalid key length may result in undefined behaviour (e.g. buffer
 * overflow).
 *
 * Subkey structures contain no interior pointer, and no external
 * resources are allocated upon key expansion. They can thus be
 * discarded without any explicit deallocation.
 *
 *
 * ## Object-Oriented API
 *
 * Each context structure begins with a field (called `vtable`) that
 * points to an instance of a structure that references the relevant
 * functions through pointers. Each such structure contains the
 * following:
 *
 *   - `context_size`
 *
 *     The size (in bytes) of the context structure for subkeys.
 *
 *   - `block_size`
 *
 *     The cipher block size (in bytes).
 *
 *   - `log_block_size`
 *
 *     The base-2 logarithm of cipher block size (e.g. 4 for blocks
 *     of 16 bytes).
 *
 *   - `init`
 *
 *     Pointer to the key expansion function.
 *
 *   - `run`
 *
 *     Pointer to the encryption/decryption function.
 *
 * For combined CTR/CBC-MAC encryption, the `vtable` has a slightly
 * different structure:
 *
 *   - `context_size`
 *
 *     The size (in bytes) of the context structure for subkeys.
 *
 *   - `block_size`
 *
 *     The cipher block size (in bytes).
 *
 *   - `log_block_size`
 *
 *     The base-2 logarithm of cipher block size (e.g. 4 for blocks
 *     of 16 bytes).
 *
 *   - `init`
 *
 *     Pointer to the key expansion function.
 *
 *   - `encrypt`
 *
 *     Pointer to the CTR encryption + CBC-MAC function.
 *
 *   - `decrypt`
 *
 *     Pointer to the CTR decryption + CBC-MAC function.
 *
 *   - `ctr`
 *
 *     Pointer to the CTR encryption/decryption function.
 *
 *   - `mac`
 *
 *     Pointer to the CBC-MAC function.
 *
 * For block cipher "`xxx`", static, constant instances of these
 * structures are defined, under the names:
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcenc_vtable`
 *   - `br_xxx_cbcdec_vtable`
 *   - `br_xxx_ctr_vtable`
 *   - `br_xxx_ctrcbc_vtable`
 *
 *
 * ## Implemented Block Ciphers
 * 
 * Provided implementations are:
 *
 * | Name      | Function | Block Size (bytes) | Key lengths (bytes) |
 * | :-------- | :------- | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
 * | aes_big   | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | aes_small | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | aes_ct    | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | aes_ct64  | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | aes_x86ni | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | aes_pwr8  | AES      |        16          | 16, 24 and 32       |
 * | des_ct    | DES/3DES |         8          | 8, 16 and 24        |
 * | des_tab   | DES/3DES |         8          | 8, 16 and 24        |
 *
 * **Note:** DES/3DES nominally uses keys of 64, 128 and 192 bits (i.e. 8,
 * 16 and 24 bytes), but some of the bits are ignored by the algorithm, so
 * the _effective_ key lengths, from a security point of view, are 56,
 * 112 and 168 bits, respectively.
 *
 * `aes_big` is a "classical" AES implementation, using tables. It
 * is fast but not constant-time, since it makes data-dependent array
 * accesses.
 *
 * `aes_small` is an AES implementation optimized for code size. It
 * is substantially slower than `aes_big`; it is not constant-time
 * either.
 *
 * `aes_ct` is a constant-time implementation of AES; its code is about
 * as big as that of `aes_big`, while its performance is comparable to
 * that of `aes_small`. However, it is constant-time. This
 * implementation should thus be considered to be the "default" AES in
 * BearSSL, to be used unless the operational context guarantees that a
 * non-constant-time implementation is safe, or an architecture-specific
 * constant-time implementation can be used (e.g. using dedicated
 * hardware opcodes).
 *
 * `aes_ct64` is another constant-time implementation of AES. It is
 * similar to `aes_ct` but uses 64-bit values. On 32-bit machines,
 * `aes_ct64` is not faster than `aes_ct`, often a bit slower, and has
 * a larger footprint; however, on 64-bit architectures, `aes_ct64`
 * is typically twice faster than `aes_ct` for modes that allow parallel
 * operations (i.e. CTR, and CBC decryption, but not CBC encryption).
 *
 * `aes_x86ni` exists only on x86 architectures (32-bit and 64-bit). It
 * uses the AES-NI opcodes when available.
 *
 * `aes_pwr8` exists only on PowerPC / POWER architectures (32-bit and
 * 64-bit, both little-endian and big-endian). It uses the AES opcodes
 * present in POWER8 and later.
 *
 * `des_tab` is a classic, table-based implementation of DES/3DES. It
 * is not constant-time.
 *
 * `des_ct` is an constant-time implementation of DES/3DES. It is
 * substantially slower than `des_tab`.
 *
 * ## ChaCha20 and Poly1305
 *
 * ChaCha20 is a stream cipher. Poly1305 is a MAC algorithm. They
 * are described in [RFC 7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539).
 *
 * Two function pointer types are defined:
 *
 *   - `br_chacha20_run` describes a function that implements ChaCha20
 *     only.
 *
 *   - `br_poly1305_run` describes an implementation of Poly1305,
 *     in the AEAD combination with ChaCha20 specified in RFC 7539
 *     (the ChaCha20 implementation is provided as a function pointer).
 *
 * `chacha20_ct` is a straightforward implementation of ChaCha20 in
 * plain C; it is constant-time, small, and reasonably fast.
 *
 * `chacha20_sse2` leverages SSE2 opcodes (on x86 architectures that
 * support these opcodes). It is faster than `chacha20_ct`.
 *
 * `poly1305_ctmul` is an implementation of the ChaCha20+Poly1305 AEAD
 * construction, where the Poly1305 part is performed with mixed 32-bit
 * multiplications (operands are 32-bit, result is 64-bit).
 *
 * `poly1305_ctmul32` implements ChaCha20+Poly1305 using pure 32-bit
 * multiplications (32-bit operands, 32-bit result). It is slower than
 * `poly1305_ctmul`, except on some specific architectures such as
 * the ARM Cortex M0+.
 *
 * `poly1305_ctmulq` implements ChaCha20+Poly1305 with mixed 64-bit
 * multiplications (operands are 64-bit, result is 128-bit) on 64-bit
 * platforms that support such operations.
 *
 * `poly1305_i15` implements ChaCha20+Poly1305 with the generic "i15"
 * big integer implementation. It is meant mostly for testing purposes,
 * although it can help with saving a few hundred bytes of code footprint
 * on systems where code size is scarce.

 *
 * # PEM Support
 *
 * PEM is a traditional encoding layer use to store binary objects (in
 * particular X.509 certificates, and private keys) in text files. While
 * the acronym comes from an old, defunct standard ("Privacy Enhanced
 * Mail"), the format has been reused, with some variations, by many
 * systems, and is a _de facto_ standard, even though it is not, actually,
 * specified in all clarity anywhere.
 *
 * ## Format Details
 *
 * BearSSL contains a generic, streamed PEM decoder, which handles the
 * following format:
 *
 *   - The input source (a sequence of bytes) is assumed to be the
 *     encoding of a text file in an ASCII-compatible charset. This
 *     includes ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and UTF-8 encodings. Each
 *     line ends on a newline character (U+000A LINE FEED). The
 *     U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters are ignored, so the code
 *     accepts both Windows-style and Unix-style line endings.
 *
 *   - Each object begins with a banner that occurs at the start of
 *     a line; the first banner characters are "`-----BEGIN `" (five
 *     dashes, the word "BEGIN", and a space). The banner matching is
 *     not case-sensitive.
 *
 *   - The _object name_ consists in the characters that follow the
 *     banner start sequence, up to the end of the line, but without
 *     trailing dashes (in "normal" PEM, there are five trailing
 *     dashes, but this implementation is not picky about these dashes).
 *     The BearSSL decoder normalises the name characters to uppercase
 *     (for ASCII letters only) and accepts names up to 127 characters.
 *
 *   - The object ends with a banner that again occurs at the start of
 *     a line, and starts with "`-----END `" (again case-insensitive).
 *
 *   - Between that start and end banner, only Base64 data shall occur.
 *     Base64 converts each sequence of three bytes into four
 *     characters; the four characters are ASCII letters, digits, "`+`"
 *     or "`-`" signs, and one or two "`=`" signs may occur in the last
 *     quartet. Whitespace is ignored (whitespace is any ASCII character
 *     of code 32 or less, so control characters are whitespace) and
 *     lines may have arbitrary length; the only restriction is that the
 *     four characters of a quartet must appear on the same line (no
 *     line break inside a quartet).
 *
 *   - A single file may contain more than one PEM object. Bytes that
 *     occur between objects are ignored.
 *
 *
 * ## PEM Decoder API
 *
 * The PEM decoder offers a state-machine API. The caller allocates a
 * decoder context, then injects source bytes. Source bytes are pushed
 * with `br_pem_decoder_push()`. The decoder stops accepting bytes when
 * it reaches an "event", which is either the start of an object, the
 * end of an object, or a decoding error within an object.
 *
 * The `br_pem_decoder_event()` function is used to obtain the current
 * event; it also clears it, thus allowing the decoder to accept more
 * bytes. When a object start event is raised, the decoder context
 * offers the found object name (normalised to ASCII uppercase).
 *
 * When an object is reached, the caller must set an appropriate callback
 * function, which will receive (by chunks) the decoded object data.
 *
 * Since the decoder context makes no dynamic allocation, it requires
 * no explicit deallocation.

 * # Key Derivation Functions
 *
 * KDF are functions that takes a variable length input, and provide a
 * variable length output, meant to be used to derive subkeys from a
 * master key.
 *
 * ## HKDF
 *
 * HKDF is a KDF defined by [RFC 5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869).
 * It is based on HMAC, itself using an underlying hash function. Any
 * hash function can be used, as long as it is compatible with the rules
 * for the HMAC implementation (i.e. output size is 64 bytes or less, hash
 * internal state size is 64 bytes or less, and the internal block length is
 * a power of 2 between 16 and 256 bytes). HKDF has two phases:
 *
 *  - HKDF-Extract: the input data in ingested, along with a "salt" value.
 *
 *  - HKDF-Expand: the output is produced, from the result of processing
 *    the input and salt, and using an extra non-secret parameter called
 *    "info".
 *
 * The "salt" and "info" strings are non-secret and can be empty. Their role
 * is normally to bind the input and output, respectively, to conventional
 * identifiers that qualifu them within the used protocol or application.
 *
 * The implementation defined in this file uses the following functions:
 *
 *  - `br_hkdf_init()`: initialize an HKDF context, with a hash function,
 *    and the salt. This starts the HKDF-Extract process.
 *
 *  - `br_hkdf_inject()`: inject more input bytes. This function may be
 *    called repeatedly if the input data is provided by chunks.
 *
 *  - `br_hkdf_flip()`: end the HKDF-Extract process, and start the
 *    HKDF-Expand process.
 *
 *  - `br_hkdf_produce()`: get the next bytes of output. This function
 *    may be called several times to obtain the full output by chunks.
 *    For correct HKDF processing, the same "info" string must be
 *    provided for each call.
 *
 * Note that the HKDF total output size (the number of bytes that
 * HKDF-Expand is willing to produce) is limited: if the hash output size
 * is _n_ bytes, then the maximum output size is _255*n_.
 */

 * # Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data
 *
 * This file documents the API for AEAD encryption.
 *
 *
 * ## Procedural API
 *
 * An AEAD algorithm processes messages and provides confidentiality
 * (encryption) and checked integrity (MAC). It uses the following
 * parameters:
 *
 *   - A symmetric key. Exact size depends on the AEAD algorithm.
 *
 *   - A nonce (IV). Size depends on the AEAD algorithm; for most
 *     algorithms, it is crucial for security that any given nonce
 *     value is never used twice for the same key and distinct
 *     messages.
 *
 *   - Data to encrypt and protect.
 *
 *   - Additional authenticated data, which is covered by the MAC but
 *     otherwise left untouched (i.e. not encrypted).
 *
 * The AEAD algorithm encrypts the data, and produces an authentication
 * tag. It is assumed that the encrypted data, the tag, the additional
 * authenticated data and the nonce are sent to the receiver; the
 * additional data and the nonce may be implicit (e.g. using elements of
 * the underlying transport protocol, such as record sequence numbers).
 * The receiver will recompute the tag value and compare it with the one
 * received; if they match, then the data is correct, and can be
 * decrypted and used; otherwise, at least one of the elements was
 * altered in transit, normally leading to wholesale rejection of the
 * complete message.
 *
 * For each AEAD algorithm, identified by a symbolic name (hereafter
 * denoted as "`xxx`"), the following functions are defined:
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_init()`
 *
 *     Initialise the AEAD algorithm, on a provided context structure.
 *     Exact parameters depend on the algorithm, and may include
 *     pointers to extra implementations and context structures. The
 *     secret key is provided at this point, either directly or
 *     indirectly.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_reset()`
 *
 *     Start a new AEAD computation. The nonce value is provided as
 *     parameter to this function.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_aad_inject()`
 *
 *     Inject some additional authenticated data. Additional data may
 *     be provided in several chunks of arbitrary length.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_flip()`
 *
 *     This function MUST be called after injecting all additional
 *     authenticated data, and before beginning to encrypt the plaintext
 *     (or decrypt the ciphertext).
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_run()`
 *
 *     Process some plaintext (to encrypt) or ciphertext (to decrypt).
 *     Encryption/decryption is done in place. Data may be provided in
 *     several chunks of arbitrary length.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_get_tag()`
 *
 *     Compute the authentication tag. All message data (encrypted or
 *     decrypted) must have been injected at that point. Also, this
 *     call may modify internal context elements, so it may be called
 *     only once for a given AEAD computation.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_check_tag()`
 *
 *     An alternative to `br_xxx_get_tag()`, meant to be used by the
 *     receiver: the authentication tag is internally recomputed, and
 *     compared with the one provided as parameter.
 *
 * This API makes the following assumptions on the AEAD algorithm:
 *
 *   - Encryption does not expand the size of the ciphertext; there is
 *     no padding. This is true of most modern AEAD modes such as GCM.
 *
 *   - The additional authenticated data must be processed first,
 *     before the encrypted/decrypted data.
 *
 *   - Nonce, plaintext and additional authenticated data all consist
 *     in an integral number of bytes. There is no provision to use
 *     elements whose length in bits is not a multiple of 8.
 *
 * Each AEAD algorithm has its own requirements and limits on the sizes
 * of additional data and plaintext. This API does not provide any
 * way to report invalid usage; it is up to the caller to ensure that
 * the provided key, nonce, and data elements all fit the algorithm's
 * requirements.
 *
 *
 * ## Object-Oriented API
 *
 * Each context structure begins with a field (called `vtable`) that
 * points to an instance of a structure that references the relevant
 * functions through pointers. Each such structure contains the
 * following:
 *
 *   - `reset`
 *
 *     Pointer to the reset function, that allows starting a new
 *     computation.
 *
 *   - `aad_inject`
 *
 *     Pointer to the additional authenticated data injection function.
 *
 *   - `flip`
 *
 *     Pointer to the function that transitions from additional data
 *     to main message data processing.
 *
 *   - `get_tag`
 *
 *     Pointer to the function that computes and returns the tag.
 *
 *   - `check_tag`
 *
 *     Pointer to the function that computes and verifies the tag against
 *     a received value.
 *
 * Note that there is no OOP method for context initialisation: the
 * various AEAD algorithms have different requirements that would not
 * map well to a single initialisation API.
 *
 * The OOP API is not provided for CCM, due to its specific requirements
 * (length of plaintext must be known in advance).

 * # Pseudo-Random Generators
 *
 * A PRNG is a state-based engine that outputs pseudo-random bytes on
 * demand. It is initialized with an initial seed, and additional seed
 * bytes can be added afterwards. Bytes produced depend on the seeds and
 * also on the exact sequence of calls (including sizes requested for
 * each call).
 *
 *
 * ## Procedural and OOP API
 *
 * For the PRNG of name "`xxx`", two API are provided. The _procedural_
 * API defined a context structure `br_xxx_context` and three functions:
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_init()`
 *
 *     Initialise the context with an initial seed.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_generate()`
 *
 *     Produce some pseudo-random bytes.
 *
 *   - `br_xxx_update()`
 *
 *     Inject some additional seed.
 *
 * The initialisation function sets the first context field (`vtable`)
 * to a pointer to the vtable that supports the OOP API. The OOP API
 * provides access to the same functions through function pointers,
 * named `init()`, `generate()` and `update()`.
 *
 * Note that the context initialisation method may accept additional
 * parameters, provided as a 'const void *' pointer at API level. These
 * additional parameters depend on the implemented PRNG.
 *
 *
 * ## HMAC_DRBG
 *
 * HMAC_DRBG is defined in [NIST SP 800-90A Revision
 * 1](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1.pdf).
 * It uses HMAC repeatedly, over some configurable underlying hash
 * function. In BearSSL, it is implemented under the "`hmac_drbg`" name.
 * The "extra parameters" pointer for context initialisation should be
 * set to a pointer to the vtable for the underlying hash function (e.g.
 * pointer to `br_sha256_vtable` to use HMAC_DRBG with SHA-256).
 *
 * According to the NIST standard, each request shall produce up to
 * 2<sup>19</sup> bits (i.e. 64 kB of data); moreover, the context shall
 * be reseeded at least once every 2<sup>48</sup> requests. This
 * implementation does not maintain the reseed counter (the threshold is
 * too high to be reached in practice) and does not object to producing
 * more than 64 kB in a single request; thus, the code cannot fail,
 * which corresponds to the fact that the API has no room for error
 * codes. However, this implies that requesting more than 64 kB in one
 * `generate()` request, or making more than 2<sup>48</sup> requests
 * without reseeding, is formally out of NIST specification. There is
 * no currently known security penalty for exceeding the NIST limits,
 * and, in any case, HMAC_DRBG usage in implementing SSL/TLS always
 * stays much below these thresholds.
 *
 *
 * ## AESCTR_DRBG
 *
 * AESCTR_DRBG is a custom PRNG based on AES-128 in CTR mode. This is
 * meant to be used only in situations where you are desperate for
 * speed, and have an hardware-optimized AES/CTR implementation. Whether
 * this will yield perceptible improvements depends on what you use the
 * pseudorandom bytes for, and how many you want; for instance, RSA key
 * pair generation uses a substantial amount of randomness, and using
 * AESCTR_DRBG instead of HMAC_DRBG yields a 15 to 20% increase in key
 * generation speed on a recent x86 CPU (Intel Core i7-6567U at 3.30 GHz).
 *
 * Internally, it uses CTR mode with successive counter values, starting
 * at zero (counter value expressed over 128 bits, big-endian convention).
 * The counter is not allowed to reach 32768; thus, every 32768*16 bytes
 * at most, the `update()` function is run (on an empty seed, if none is
 * provided). The `update()` function computes the new AES-128 key by
 * applying a custom hash function to the concatenation of a state-dependent
 * word (encryption of an all-one block with the current key) and the new
 * seed. The custom hash function uses Hirose's construction over AES-256;
 * see the comments in `aesctr_drbg.c` for details.
 *
 * This DRBG does not follow an existing standard, and thus should be
 * considered as inadequate for production use until it has been properly
 * analysed.

 *
 * # RSA
 *
 * This file documents the RSA implementations provided with BearSSL.
 * Note that the SSL engine accesses these implementations through a
 * configurable API, so it is possible to, for instance, run a SSL
 * server which uses a RSA engine which is not based on this code.
 *
 * ## Key Elements
 *
 * RSA public and private keys consist in lists of big integers. All
 * such integers are represented with big-endian unsigned notation:
 * first byte is the most significant, and the value is positive (so
 * there is no dedicated "sign bit"). Public and private key structures
 * thus contain, for each such integer, a pointer to the first value byte
 * (`unsigned char *`), and a length (`size_t`) which is the number of
 * relevant bytes. As a general rule, minimal-length encoding is not
 * enforced: values may have extra leading bytes of value 0.
 *
 * RSA public keys consist in two integers:
 *
 *   - the modulus (`n`);
 *   - the public exponent (`e`).
 *
 * RSA private keys, as defined in
 * [PKCS#1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447), contain eight integers:
 *
 *   - the modulus (`n`);
 *   - the public exponent (`e`);
 *   - the private exponent (`d`);
 *   - the first prime factor (`p`);
 *   - the second prime factor (`q`);
 *   - the first reduced exponent (`dp`, which is `d` modulo `p-1`);
 *   - the second reduced exponent (`dq`, which is `d` modulo `q-1`);
 *   - the CRT coefficient (`iq`, the inverse of `q` modulo `p`).
 *
 * However, the implementations defined in BearSSL use only five of
 * these integers: `p`, `q`, `dp`, `dq` and `iq`.
 *
 * ## Security Features and Limitations
 *
 * The implementations contained in BearSSL have the following limitations
 * and features:
 *
 *   - They are constant-time. This means that the execution time and
 *     memory access pattern may depend on the _lengths_ of the private
 *     key components, but not on their value, nor on the value of
 *     the operand. Note that this property is not achieved through
 *     random masking, but "true" constant-time code.
 *
 *   - They support only private keys with two prime factors. RSA private
 *     keys with three or more prime factors are nominally supported, but
 *     rarely used; they may offer faster operations, at the expense of
 *     more code and potentially a reduction in security if there are
 *     "too many" prime factors.
 *
 *   - The public exponent may have arbitrary length. Of course, it is
 *     a good idea to keep public exponents small, so that public key
 *     operations are fast; but, contrary to some widely deployed
 *     implementations, BearSSL has no problem with public exponents
 *     longer than 32 bits.
 *
 *   - The two prime factors of the modulus need not have the same length
 *     (but severely imbalanced factor lengths might reduce security).
 *     Similarly, there is no requirement that the first factor (`p`)
 *     be greater than the second factor (`q`).
 *
 *   - Prime factors and modulus must be smaller than a compile-time limit.
 *     This is made necessary by the use of fixed-size stack buffers, and
 *     the limit has been adjusted to keep stack usage under 2 kB for the
 *     RSA operations. Currently, the maximum modulus size is 4096 bits,
 *     and the maximum prime factor size is 2080 bits.
 *
 *   - The RSA functions themselves do not enforce lower size limits,
 *     except that which is absolutely necessary for the operation to
 *     mathematically make sense (e.g. a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature with
 *     SHA-1 requires a modulus of at least 361 bits). It is up to users
 *     of this code to enforce size limitations when appropriate (e.g.
 *     the X.509 validation engine, by default, rejects RSA keys of
 *     less than 1017 bits).
 *
 *   - Within the size constraints expressed above, arbitrary bit lengths
 *     are supported. There is no requirement that prime factors or
 *     modulus have a size multiple of 8 or 16.
 *
 *   - When verifying PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, both variants of the hash
 *     function identifying header (with and without the ASN.1 NULL) are
 *     supported. When producing such signatures, the variant with the
 *     ASN.1 NULL is used.
 *
 * ## Implementations
 *
 * Three RSA implementations are included:
 *
 *   - The **i32** implementation internally represents big integers
 *     as arrays of 32-bit integers. It is perfunctory and portable,
 *     but not very efficient.
 *
 *   - The **i31** implementation uses 32-bit integers, each containing
 *     31 bits worth of integer data. The i31 implementation is somewhat
 *     faster than the i32 implementation (the reduced integer size makes
 *     carry propagation easier) for a similar code footprint, but uses
 *     very slightly larger stack buffers (about 4% bigger).
 *
 *   - The **i62** implementation is similar to the i31 implementation,
 *     except that it internally leverages the 64x64->128 multiplication
 *     opcode. This implementation is available only on architectures
 *     where such an opcode exists. It is much faster than i31.
 *
 *   - The **i15** implementation uses 16-bit integers, each containing
 *     15 bits worth of integer data. Multiplication results fit on
 *     32 bits, so this won't use the "widening" multiplication routine
 *     on ARM Cortex M0/M0+, for much better performance and constant-time
 *     execution.

 * # Elliptic Curves
 *
 * This file documents the EC implementations provided with BearSSL, and
 * ECDSA.
 *
 * ## Elliptic Curve API
 *
 * Only "named curves" are supported. Each EC implementation supports
 * one or several named curves, identified by symbolic identifiers.
 * These identifiers are small integers, that correspond to the values
 * registered by the
 * [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8).
 *
 * Since all currently defined elliptic curve identifiers are in the 0..31
 * range, it is convenient to encode support of some curves in a 32-bit
 * word, such that bit x corresponds to curve of identifier x.
 *
 * An EC implementation is incarnated by a `br_ec_impl` instance, that
 * offers the following fields:
 *
 *   - `supported_curves`
 *
 *      A 32-bit word that documents the identifiers of the curves supported
 *      by this implementation.
 *
 *   - `generator()`
 *
 *      Callback method that returns a pointer to the conventional generator
 *      point for that curve.
 *
 *   - `order()`
 *
 *      Callback method that returns a pointer to the subgroup order for
 *      that curve. That value uses unsigned big-endian encoding.
 *
 *   - `xoff()`
 *
 *      Callback method that returns the offset and length of the X
 *      coordinate in an encoded point.
 *
 *   - `mul()`
 *
 *      Multiply a curve point with an integer.
 *
 *   - `mulgen()`
 *
 *      Multiply the curve generator with an integer. This may be faster
 *      than the generic `mul()`.
 *
 *   - `muladd()`
 *
 *      Multiply two curve points by two integers, and return the sum of
 *      the two products.
 *
 * All curve points are represented in uncompressed format. The `mul()`
 * and `muladd()` methods take care to validate that the provided points
 * are really part of the relevant curve subgroup.
 *
 * For all point multiplication functions, the following holds:
 *
 *   - Functions validate that the provided points are valid members
 *     of the relevant curve subgroup. An error is reported if that is
 *     not the case.
 *
 *   - Processing is constant-time, even if the point operands are not
 *     valid. This holds for both the source and resulting points, and
 *     the multipliers (integers). Only the byte length of the provided
 *     multiplier arrays (not their actual value length in bits) may
 *     leak through timing-based side channels.
 *
 *   - The multipliers (integers) MUST be lower than the subgroup order.
 *     If this property is not met, then the result is indeterminate,
 *     but an error value is not ncessearily returned.
 * 
 *
 * ## ECDSA
 *
 * ECDSA signatures have two standard formats, called "raw" and "asn1".
 * Internally, such a signature is a pair of modular integers `(r,s)`.
 * The "raw" format is the concatenation of the unsigned big-endian
 * encodings of these two integers, possibly left-padded with zeros so
 * that they have the same encoded length. The "asn1" format is the
 * DER encoding of an ASN.1 structure that contains the two integer
 * values:
 *
 *     ECDSASignature ::= SEQUENCE {
 *         r   INTEGER,
 *         s   INTEGER
 *     }
 *
 * In general, in all of X.509 and SSL/TLS, the "asn1" format is used.
 * BearSSL offers ECDSA implementations for both formats; conversion
 * functions between the two formats are also provided. Conversion of a
 * "raw" format signature into "asn1" may enlarge a signature by no more
 * than 9 bytes for all supported curves; conversely, conversion of an
 * "asn1" signature to "raw" may expand the signature but the "raw"
 * length will never be more than twice the length of the "asn1" length
 * (and usually it will be shorter).
 *
 * Note that for a given signature, the "raw" format is not fully
 * deterministic, in that it does not enforce a minimal common length.

 * # X.509 Certificate Chain Processing
 *
 * An X.509 processing engine receives an X.509 chain, chunk by chunk,
 * as received from a SSL/TLS client or server (the client receives the
 * server's certificate chain, and the server receives the client's
 * certificate chain if it requested a client certificate). The chain
 * is thus injected in the engine in SSL order (end-entity first).
 *
 * The engine's job is to return the public key to use for SSL/TLS.
 * How exactly that key is obtained and verified is entirely up to the
 * engine.
 *
 * **The "known key" engine** returns a public key which is already known
 * from out-of-band information (e.g. the client _remembers_ the key from
 * a previous connection, as in the usual SSH model). This is the simplest
 * engine since it simply ignores the chain, thereby avoiding the need
 * for any decoding logic.
 *
 * **The "minimal" engine** implements minimal X.509 decoding and chain
 * validation:
 *
 *   - The provided chain should validate "as is". There is no attempt
 *     at reordering, skipping or downloading extra certificates.
 *
 *   - X.509 v1, v2 and v3 certificates are supported.
 *
 *   - Trust anchors are a DN and a public key. Each anchor is either a
 *     "CA" anchor, or a non-CA.
 *
 *   - If the end-entity certificate matches a non-CA anchor (subject DN
 *     is equal to the non-CA name, and public key is also identical to
 *     the anchor key), then this is a _direct trust_ case and the
 *     remaining certificates are ignored.
 *
 *   - Unless direct trust is applied, the chain must be verifiable up to
 *     a certificate whose issuer DN matches the DN from a "CA" trust anchor,
 *     and whose signature is verifiable against that anchor's public key.
 *     Subsequent certificates in the chain are ignored.
 *
 *   - The engine verifies subject/issuer DN matching, and enforces
 *     processing of Basic Constraints and Key Usage extensions. The
 *     Authority Key Identifier, Subject Key Identifier, Issuer Alt Name,
 *     Subject Directory Attribute, CRL Distribution Points, Freshest CRL,
 *     Authority Info Access and Subject Info Access extensions are
 *     ignored. The Subject Alt Name is decoded for the end-entity
 *     certificate under some conditions (see below). Other extensions
 *     are ignored if non-critical, or imply chain rejection if critical.
 *
 *   - The Subject Alt Name extension is parsed for names of type `dNSName`
 *     when decoding the end-entity certificate, and only if there is a
 *     server name to match. If there is no SAN extension, then the
 *     Common Name from the subjectDN is used. That name matching is
 *     case-insensitive and honours a single starting wildcard (i.e. if
 *     the name in the certificate starts with "`*.`" then this matches
 *     any word as first element). Note: this name matching is performed
 *     also in the "direct trust" model.
 *
 *   - DN matching is byte-to-byte equality (a future version might
 *     include some limited processing for case-insensitive matching and
 *     whitespace normalisation).
 *
 *   - Successful validation produces a public key type but also a set
 *     of allowed usages (`BR_KEYTYPE_KEYX` and/or `BR_KEYTYPE_SIGN`).
 *     The caller is responsible for checking that the key type and
 *     usages are compatible with the expected values (e.g. with the
 *     selected cipher suite, when the client validates the server's
 *     certificate).
 *
 * **Important caveats:**
 *
 *   - The "minimal" engine does not check revocation status. The relevant
 *     extensions are ignored, and CRL or OCSP responses are not gathered
 *     or checked.
 *
 *   - The "minimal" engine does not currently support Name Constraints
 *     (some basic functionality to handle sub-domains may be added in a
 *     later version).
 *
 *   - The decoder is not "validating" in the sense that it won't reject
 *     some certificates with invalid field values when these fields are
 *     not actually processed.

/**
 * \brief Initialise a simplified I/O wrapper context.
 *
 * The simplified I/O wrapper offers a simpler read/write API for a SSL
 * engine (client or server), using the provided callback functions for
 * reading data from, or writing data to, the transport medium.
 *
 * The callback functions have the following semantics:
 *
 *   - Each callback receives an opaque context value (of type `void *`)
 *     that the callback may use arbitrarily (or possibly ignore).
 *
 *   - `low_read()` reads at least one byte, at most `len` bytes, from
 *     the transport medium. Read bytes shall be written in `data`.
 *
 *   - `low_write()` writes at least one byte, at most `len` bytes, unto
 *     the transport medium. The bytes to write are read from `data`.
 *
 *   - The `len` parameter is never zero, and is always lower than 20000.
 *
 *   - The number of processed bytes (read or written) is returned. Since
 *     that number is less than 20000, it always fits on an `int`.
 *
 *   - On error, the callbacks return -1. Reaching end-of-stream is an
 *     error. Errors are permanent: the SSL connection is terminated.
 *
 *   - Callbacks SHOULD NOT return 0. This is tolerated, as long as
 *     callbacks endeavour to block for some non-negligible amount of
 *     time until at least one byte can be sent or received (if a
 *     callback returns 0, then the wrapper invokes it again
 *     immediately).
 *
 *   - Callbacks MAY return as soon as at least one byte is processed;
 *     they MAY also insist on reading or writing _all_ requested bytes.
 *     Since SSL is a self-terminated protocol (each record has a length
 *     header), this does not change semantics.
 *
 *   - Callbacks need not apply any buffering (for performance) since SSL
 *     itself uses buffers.
 *
 * \param ctx             wrapper context to initialise.

 * \param read_context    context pointer for `low_read()`.

 * types, being signed, trigger implementation-defined behaviour on
