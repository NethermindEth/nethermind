"On Linux our networking library is not closing socket descriptors "
"properly. This results in the number of open files for the process "
"growing indefinitely. Limits for the number of open files per process are"
" different for root and other users. For root the limits are usually very"
" high and the socket descriptors would probably not cause much trouble. "
"Many of the cloud operators are launching VMs with root user access by "
"default. If Nethermind process is frequently killed by OS then you may "
"need to change the configuration for the maximum number of open files."
