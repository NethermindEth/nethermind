Hardware Requirements
*********************

Generally the faster IO operations the better. For this reason Digital Ocean and UpCloud are so far the best cloud providers we have tested when running Nethermind nodes.

 Goerli Fast Sync
  8GB disk space | 1GB RAM | 1 Core CPU
 
 Mainnet Fast Sync
  100GB to 200GB disk space | 4GB RAM |2 Cores CPU

After startup the node will display the estimated max memory usage but not everything is accounted for and some block processing / some fast sync temporary caches may go above these values.
