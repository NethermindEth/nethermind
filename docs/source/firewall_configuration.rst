Firewall Configuration
**********************

Keep 8545 (or 8000-9000) closed except for the trusted machines - this is the JSON RPC port which gives admin access to the node.


Keep TCP 30303 (or 30300-30400) open for the outside world so other nodes can connect to your node.

Keep UDP 30303 (or 30300-30400) open for the outside world so other nodes can discover your node.
