Metrics
********

Nethermind metrics can be consumed by Prometheus/Grafana if configured in Metrics configuration category (check configuration documentation for details). Metrics then can be used to monitor running nodes.


Metrics infrastracture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metrics can be enabled by simply passing ``--Metrics.Enabled true`` argument to the ``Nethermind.Runner`` or ``Nethermind.Launcher`` e.g. ``./Nethermind.Runner --Metrics.Enabled true``. ``Metrics.PushGatewayUrl`` will need to be amended if pushgateway endpoint is not default.

Setting up Prometheus and Pushgateway
-------------------------------------

Prometheus GitHub `<https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus>`_.

Pushgateway GitHub `<https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway>`_.

1. Basic configuration for Prometheus:

Create ``prometheus`` directory and save below file 

``prometheus.yml``::

 global:
   scrape_interval:     5s
   evaluation_interval: 5s

 scrape_configs:
   - job_name: 'pushgateway'
     honor_labels: true
     static_configs:
     - targets: ['localhost:9091']

2. Create ``docker-compose`` file outside ``prometheus`` directory

Example of ``docker-compose`` file running both Prometheus and Pushgateway:

``docker-compose.yml``::

 version: "3.5"

 services:

     prometheus:
         image: prom/prometheus
         container_name: prometheus
         volumes:
             - ./prometheus/:/etc/prometheus/
             - prometheus_data:/prometheus
         command:
             - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
             - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
             - '--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries'
             - '--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles'
             - '--storage.tsdb.retention=200h'
             - '--web.enable-lifecycle'
         restart: unless-stopped
         expose:
             - 9090
         ports: 
             - "127.0.0.1:9090:9090"
         networks:
             - metrics


     pushgateway:
         image: prom/pushgateway
         container_name: pushgateway
         restart: unless-stopped
         expose:
             - 9091
         ports:
             - "9091:9091"
         networks:
             - metrics

 networks:
     metrics:
         driver: bridge

 volumes:
     prometheus_data: {}

3. Run ``docker-compose up``

Prometheus instance should be now running on ``http://localhost:9090/``.

Pushgateway on ``http://localhost:9091/``.

4. Run the ``Nethermind`` node with ``Metrics`` enabled and you should see metrics inflowing

5. You can now use this data and create some awesome dashboards in your favourite data visualization tool e.g. Grafana, Splunk etc.
