# Security policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our code, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible.
We ask that you do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to investigate and address it. 

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, go to [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/security/advisories/new). This will create a draft advisory. Please provide as much detail as possible including steps to reproduce the issue and any potential impact it may have.

Alternatively, you can also send an email to security@nethermind.io. We will work to acknowledge your report within 24 hours and will keep you informed throughout our investigation and resolution process.
