# Kute

Kute - /kjuÀêt/ - is a benchmarking tool developed at Nethermind to simulate an Ethereum Consensus Layer, expected to be used together with the Nethermind Client. The tool sends JSON-RPC messages to the Client and measures its performance.

## Prerequisites

This is a C# project and as such, it requires the [dotnet 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) SDK. Once installed, just run:

```
dotnet build [-c Release]
```

## Get JSON-RPC messages

To get real JSON-RPC messages, run the Nethermind Client using the `RpcRecorderState` state feature flag (see [JsonRpc module](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/ethereum-client/configuration/jsonrpc)). The minimum required value is `Request` (`All` is also valid); this usually involves adding `--JsonRpc.RpcRecorderState <Request|All>` to your execution flags.

## Run

> We'll assume that the JWT secret used by the Nethermind Client is stored in `/keystore/jwt-secret`.

Kute includes a built in help that can be accessed by the options `-h | --help`.

Some typical usages are as follows:

### Connect to a Nethermind Client running at a specific address using a single file

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0
```

### Use all messages in the directory `/rpc-logs`

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc-logs
```

### Use a single messages file and emit results as JSON

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -o Json
```

### Use a single message file and emit results as JSON, while reporting metrics to a Prometheus Push Gateway (*)

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -o Json -g http://localhost:9091
```

### Use a single messages file and record all responses into a new file

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -r rpc.responses.txt
```

### Use a single message file, using only `engine` and `eth` methods

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -f engine,eth
```

### Use a single message file, using only the first 100 methods

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -f .*=100
```

### Use a single message file, using only the first 50 `engine_newPayloadV2` or `engine_newPayloadV3` methods

```
-a http://localhost:8551 -s /keystore/jwt-secret -i /rpc.0 -f engine_newPayloadV[23]=50
```

### Prometheus Push Gateway

Since Kute is not a long-lived application it's unreasonable for Prometheus and similar tools to scrape for metrics. Instead, Kute leverages [Prometheus Push Gateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway), a service that is intended to be used for ephemeral and batch jobs. Once Kute finishes processing all requests, it will report the metrics to the Gateway, which later will be scraped by Prometheus or similar tools.

### TODO

There are some features that we might add in the future, if they end up being required:

- Validate the responses from the Nethermind Client (a "pedantic" mode)
- Other report outputs (ex. CSV, HTML)
